    "Artwork Description": "Melons was painted during Hartley's travels in the south of France suggesting the style of Cezanne. Shape and color are the primary elements used in this work. An almost monochromatic color scheme is separated across the center by a white sheet of piled fabric creating a horizontally balanced design. The fabric calls to mind a mountainous landscape. Planes of color stack in horizontal registers interrupted by the two melons. Brush strokes are apparent and run parallel to each other. Forms are flat, simplified and abstract with rugged outlines. Hartley does not show much depth or perspective in this composition. \"I would rather be sure that I had placed two colors in true relationship to each other than to have exposed a wealth of emotionalism gone wrong in the name of richness of personal expression.\" From Marsden's writing titled Art and the Personal Life; written one year after Melons was painted.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born January 4, 1877 at Lewiston, Maine; died September 2, 1943 at Ellsworth, Maine. 1896: Received his initial art training in Cleveland, OH with John Semon, a local painter. 1898-9: Studied at the Cleveland Institute of Art and the Chase School in New York. 1900-04: At the age of 22, Hartley won a scholarship to study at the National Academy of Design in New York. 1909: First solo exhibition, at the prominent 291 Gallery, which was managed by famous photographer and Modern Art predicator, Alfred Stieglitz. At 291, Hartley connected with American avant-garde artists like Georgia O'Keefe and John Marin. Hartley's continuous travels were an important aspect of his life and influence on his work. 1912: Hartley went to Paris and met Gertrude Stein who had paintings by Cezanne, Matisse and Picasso hanging in her home, which inspired Hartley's work at the time. 1913: Traveled to Berlin, where he met Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc. 1925-1929: Painted in Vence and Aix-en-Provence, France using the style of Cezanne. Also traveled to Bermuda, Nova Scotia, Bavaria, Gloucester and Mexico. Consistently returned to his American roots working in the Southwestern United States and New England. 1937-1943: Held a deep love for Maine and painted there until his death. Was associated with the Modernists. Subjects include the figure, still life, coastal sea themes, mountain landscapes, military motifs, soldiers and American Indian themes. Early work exhibited influences of Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism. Later Hartley was inspired by Post-Impressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, European Modernism, German Expressionism; also, photography and mysticism.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Color: Discuss Hartley's use of color in this piece. Which other artists featured in the IMA make use of idealized, imaginary or exotic color: Modern, Pont Avon...? Contrast with dark muted colors as in the Munich paintings of the Hoosier Group and Courbet. Food in Art: Include in a tour with other paintings featuring food as the primary subject. Talk about different foods that appear in our galleries. Why is food an interesting subject for painters? How is food depicted? Abstract? Realistic? Connect to food containers in the African and Asian galleries. Also connect to food appearing as embellishment on decorative objects. Dutch still life: Make connection to Dutch still life paintings. Contrast the abstracted simplified forms in Hartley's painting to the optical realism and rendering skill of the Dutch.",
    "Connections": "Jimson Weed – Georgia O'Keefe. O'Keefe was married to photographer Alfred Stieglitz who ran the avant-garde gallery in New York, called 291. Stieglitz was a fan and supporter of Hartley. Hartley's first one man exhibition was at 291 Gallery. He worked in the American southwest as did O'Keefe. You could loosely connect to the Native American collection. Hurricane – John Marin. Hartley met John Marin at 291 Gallery. They were both from Maine and shared a great love for the area. Waves in Hurricane relate to waves of fabric in Melons. House in Provence – Paul Cezanne. Cezanne was born in Aix-en-Provence. Marsden lived and worked there for a period. Hartley was inspired by the work of Cezanne. Connect paint stroke, color, structure and geometric forms. Compare mountains in House in Provence with fabric in Melons. Show examples of Cezanne's still life paintings with fruit. Mountains and Valleys – Victor Higgins. Compare mountainous forms, horizontal registers, brush stroke. Still Life with Profile of Laval – Paul Gauguin. Make connection to Pont-Aven School. Idealized use of color, flat simplified forms. Pablo Picasso. Hartley and Picasso were contemporaries and Hartley was exposed to Picasso's work via Gertrude Stein.",

    "Micro Summary": "American modernist Marsden Hartley (1877-1943) was a well-traveled artist who studied in Paris, Berlin, and throughout Europe, developing connections with avant-garde figures like Georgia O'Keeffe, Gertrude Stein, and Wassily Kandinsky. Painted around 1927 during his time in southern France, \"Melons\" reflects Cézanne's influence through its simplified forms, monochromatic color scheme, and geometric composition. The work exemplifies Hartley's mature style, emphasizing formal relationships of color and shape over emotional expression, representing his significant contribution to American Modernism during the interwar period.",

    "Artwork Description": "The Young Artist was meant to appeal to the Boston public in many ways. It was humorous, and its moral tone was defined and clarified by the verse that accompanied it, which read, \"Fair lady, turn not by in scorn, At talent to the pencil born, Genius knows naught of age or clime, 'Tis God's own mind – 'tis all divine.\" The painting appealed to abolitionists in its quiet depiction of America's children, the country's future, putting aside issues of race to play together. The painting embodies the prevailing philosophy of America at the time as a young nation full of youthful energy and fun, where everyone can enjoy the fruits of honest labor and still have time for leisure.",
    "Artist Biography": "After completing some informal art training, Boston-born Thomas Mickell Burnham made his first trip abroad. When he returned, he took up sign painting and then opened a portrait studio, since portraiture was a lucrative practice. Success at this profession allowed Burnham to travel to Scotland in 1839. Upon his return, he began concentrating on genre and landscape painting in addition to portraiture. In the mid-nineteenth century, Burnham painted his most famous work The Lewis and Clark Expedition mostly from his imagination.",

    "Artwork Description": "Gaudens was taken by the work of Robert Louis Stevenson and said, \"…if Stevenson ever crossed to this side of the water I should consider it an honor if he would allow me to make his portrait.\" Stevenson came to America in 1887 and sat for Saint-Gaudens at the Hotel Albert in New York. This portrait relief became Saint-Gaudens' most widely produced work. To avoid the effect of mass production in the numerous castings, Saint-Gaudens varied details of the portrait and its size. The sculptor shows the popular Scottish author reclining in bed, weakened by tuberculosis, a manuscript in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Typical of Saint-Gaudens' reliefs are the lively variety of naturalist details, such as the contrast between the smooth pillowcase and the rougher blanket and bedclothes.",
    "Artist Biography": "Dublin-native Augustus Saint-Gaudens was raised in New York City after his Irish mother and French father immigrated to America, when he was six months old. He took classes at the Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design before traveling to Paris, where he studied at the École des Beaux Arts. He also studied art and architecture in Rome. Upon his return to the United States, Saint-Gaudens received critical acclaim for his monuments commemorating heroes of the American Civil War and his numerous funerary monuments and busts. His colossal Standing Lincoln in Lincoln Park, Chicago, is considered one of the finest portrait statues in America. It was followed by a seated statue of the president in Chicago's Grant Park, a copy of which was placed by Lincoln's tomb. Saint-Gaudens was an important teacher, tutoring privately and at the Art Students League of New York. He is also known for his portrait medallions and coin designs. Later in life, he founded the Cornish Colony in New Hampshire, which attracted numerous painters, architects, and sculptors, including Paul Manship, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, and the illustrator Maxfield Parrish. His house and gardens are preserved as Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site.",

Scudder was one of the premier artists of garden sculpture of her era. Frog Fountain is Scudder's best-known work. As a young artist in France, Scudder persuaded the successful American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies to break his rule against taking students. Scudder incorporated MacMonnies lively naturalistic modeling into Frog Fountain. She said that this bronze was inspired by children she observed in Italy, a country renowned for its fountain sculpture. The chubby little boy, his hair garlanded with flowers, dances between three nervous frogs. Frog Fountain is Scudder's best known work, and this bronze is one of many replicas.",
    "Artist Biography": "Determined to be an artist, Scudder left Terre Haute, Indiana in her teens to study at the Academy of Art in Cincinnati. By age 20 she was one of Lorado Taft's \"white rabbits,\" the female assistants who aided him in his many sculpture projects for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In 1894 she sought training in France, where she eventually established her home and studio. Active beyond her work as a sculptor, Scudder participated in the women's suffrage movement in the United States, wrote an autobiography entitled Modelling My Life, and was honored by France as a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur. Scudder came back to the United States nearly every year to seek fountain projects from landscape architects. During the early 20th century a wide-spread American demand for garden sculpture provided Scudder with many commissions, earning her the title \"Woman of the Fountains.\"",

    "Artwork Description": "Groll's methods are not certain but it is believed he used photographs extensively. Several separate areas of interest in this painting suggest Groll took several photographs, small oil studies or sketches back to Dusseldorf, then combined these into this larger panoramic view. Notable distortion of State House location to street can be attributed to this method, or artistic license. This cityscape features the State House, Park Theatre, and research leads us to believe the other recognizable buildings are a market stall, a bustling saloon, the Hoosier Drugstore, and a large furniture store, all which once existed along the busy commercial life of West Washington Street. Tower of the old Marion County Courthouse can be seen in background. Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument not dedicated until 1902 so is not in painting. Aside from the State House's location being too close to the street, it is suspected that the painting is generally accurate despite the sunset appearing to be in the northeast. All buildings in the painting have been destroyed except the State House so this painting is the sole known visual recording of some of these buildings. In central foreground the Blake Street trolley is hailed by a well-dressed, bearded gentleman who is probably Jacob Metzger, a resident of Indianapolis and Groll's uncle's brother-in-law. Groll belonged to the School of Dusseldorf painters of Italian scenes, along with Otto Achenbach and Albert Flamm, and exhibits an intimacy and finesse of observation, especially of architectural forms. Groll known for \"subtle\" paintings in which architecture often plays a major role. Groll exhibited this painting at the Berlin Art Exhibition in 1895.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born in Dusseldorf Feb. 9, 1857, died in Dusseldorf April 13, 1913. Groll was first a student at the Berlin Academy of Architecture, but turned from architecture to painting as a student of Kasper Scheuren. Later he made extensive study trips to Venice and Verona, Italy. Groll came to America in 1892 to judge the German paintings at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair then spent time visiting relatives in Indianapolis; he remained in Indianapolis until 1895. Groll's father married Laura Lieber of Dusseldorf. Laura's brother Herman Lieber lived in Indianapolis, was a patron of T.C. Steele, and operated an important gallery, Lieber's Art Emporium at 33 Southern Meridian St. Primarily a landscape and architectural artist.",

    "Artwork Description": "In his sculpture, Rubins sought harmonious proportions and a pensive quality that exhibits his knowledge of classical sculpture and his skill at modeling the figure. Rubins studied at the American Academy in Rome before joining the faculty at the Herron Art School in Indianapolis. In his figural sculpture, Rubins usually sought harmonious proportions and a pensive quality, preferring rounded, ideal forms to the angular or distorted. The balance and feminine grace of this bronze figure recall early twentieth-century French sculpture by artists such as Aristide Mailllol.",
    "Artist Biography": "David Rubins was born in Minneapolis and received his education at Dartmouth College. He then traveled to Europe to continue his studies at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and Académie Julian. Rubins was also a fellow in sculpture at the American Academy in Rome. His sculpture was primarily figurative and included a monument of Abraham Lincoln as a young man for the Indiana State Capitol and the bronze cherub that was on the clock during Christmas season at L. S. Ayres and Company in downtown Indianapolis. Rubins is also known for his busts of prominent people, including the architect Evans Woolen, President William Henry Harrison and Indianapolis Governor Henry Schricker. Rubins taught sculpture and anatomy at the Herron School of Art in Indianapolis.",

    "Micro Summary": "David K. Rubins' \"Seated Nude\" is a bronze sculpture that demonstrates his classical training at the American Academy in Rome and his expertise in figure modeling. The work features harmonious proportions and a contemplative quality, emphasizing rounded, idealized forms rather than angular or distorted elements. The sculpture's balance and feminine grace echo the style of early twentieth-century French sculptors like Aristide Maillol. Rubins, who later taught at Indianapolis's Herron Art School, consistently pursued this aesthetic of classical beauty and pensive tranquility in his figural works.",

    "Artwork Description": "Brook's paintings, which are consistently realistic, include portraits, still-life subjects, landscapes, and nude female figures. His color is subtle and reserved. A deep respect for human personality characterizes much of his work, often with overtones of wry humor or irony. Marsh kept his overcoat on to protect him from the cold studio and because Brook wanted to make an interesting pose and composition. An innate tenderness and fineness of texture distinguishes his paintings. He created vital, rich, emotional paintings from a low-key, almost drab palette. The mood of his paintings could be lonely, contemplative, sad, lyrical, whimsical, and even humorous. Source: Santa Fe East Galleries. His subject-matter and his attitude toward it are a highly personal response to the intimate life about him. His canvases are particularly free of any hint of the bombastic or the obviously monumental.",
    "Artist Biography": "Alexander Brook was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1898, to Russian parents. At the age of 12, Brook lost the use of his legs for several months from polio. He asked for some paints. He got them and a gentleman instructor, who specialized in painting people's deceased relatives from photographs. Brook attended Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, but was asked to leave when caught carrying a bucket of beer into the school. He wanted to paint the beer. At age17, he enrolled in the Art Students League. For four years, he studied under Kenneth Hayes Miller. He met other artists: Louis Bouche, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Reginald Marsh. He was later on the faculty. Brook is considered a key figure in the American Realist movement of the 20s and 30s. He is associated with the Fourteenth Street Group, which included Kenneth Hays Miller, Reginald Marsh, and Isabel Bishop. He painted his immediate environment -- his studio and visiting friends. He was primarily a studio painter in the realist tradition. His success began in 1929 when he won a $2,500 prize at the Art Institute of Chicago. He was successful because he organized his life on his own and on no one else's terms. At this point in 1929, he had sold 100 paintings. Source: Harry Salpeter, October 1936 Esquire. In 1920, Brook married Peggy Bacon, who was a printmaker, illustrator, poet, etcher, and caricaturist. Their daughter, Belinda, at age 15 showed promise as an artist. Their son, Sandy, was a model for his dad and became a naval aviator. Portraits of him are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney. In 1940 Life Magazine, called Brook 'one of America's best painters.' It was said he had more one-man shows than any living American artist. In 1945, he did his first magazine cover. It was for The Saturday Evening Post and was a portrait of the daughter of a New York broker. She's sitting in an upholstered chair holding a straw hat. When the realistic movement declined in the 50s, Brook isolated himself and became reclusive. He died in 1980.",

The work exemplifies Brook's deep respect for human personality and his intimate, personal approach to portraiture.

The serene sunset acts as a sign of God's blessing on the land.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born on Staten Island, New York, Cropsey trained to be an architect. His teacher encouraged him to enhance his architectural drawings with landscapes scenes, resulting in Cropsey's change in focus from architecture to landscape painting. Cropsey opened a studio in southeastern New York State. When he married in 1849, he and his wife took a two-year European honeymoon, traveling to England and Italy where he worked in the studio of Thomas Cole, founder of the Hudson River School. After returning to America, Cropsey began painting full-time. In 1856, the Cropseys again traveled to Europe, spending seven years in London, England. During his stay he fulfilled commissions from Americans wanting European subjects and European commissions for American scenes. Cropsey was commissioned by the English lithographic house of E. Gambert and Company to create a series of thirty-six paintings of American subjects. Although the series was never completed, at least eight were published in American Scenery, a portfolio of full size chromolithographs of these paintings.",

    "Artwork Description": "There is no evidence to support the traditional title A Spanish Girl or the date 1896, when Chase paid his third visit to Spain. In fact, the dress was common in the United States during the 1880s. Moreover, the style is typical of Chase's work from around the middle of that decade, which was influenced by the dark tonalities of his Munich period. The canvas is painted in broad, straight brushstrokes, which have the panache, but lack the subtlety of his mature technique. The painting nevertheless has the liveliness of his best informal portraits.",
    "Artist Biography": "A native of Indiana, Chase studied first in Indianapolis and then in Munich, where he shared a studio with Frank Duveneck. Like Duveneck, he outgrew the limitations of the Leibl School in the 1880s, but retained an allegiance to the black tones of Frans Hals and Édouard Manet. Much of his work from this period consists of casual studies. Like many other American artists of the period, Chase was at his best painting young women, whose beauty he captured and even flattered with his technique. Curiously enough, he endowed most of them, including this sitter, with the features of his wife, who provided his ideal of femininity that lasted unabated until his death.",

His work screams French, not like those from Munich. This is an unusual style for him with its glaring color and broken brushstroke. The Seiner is among the most experimental productions of the Indiana artists. Stark is the only one of the Hoosier Group to remain devoted to figure painting, and he found a way to do it economically. He found models among his family, friends, and whomever he could cajole to pose for him. Stark's figures are well and carefully drawn, more solidly rendered than their surrounding scenery. This is a local boy, F. Rusterholz, fishing in the shallows of the Whitewater River, according to Stark family documents. The Seiner remained unexhibited until after the artist's death, although a more conservative watercolor entitled Fisherboy was widely exhibited.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born 1859 - Indianapolis, Died 1926. \"Impressionism to me means retaining the first impression which nature makes upon us and rendering this impression to the exclusion of details not so essential and vital.\" quote Otto Stark. Unlike the French counterparts - American Impressionists did not dissolve forms purely into color and light, but maintained a close attachment to the subject matter. The oldest of seven children, he was born into a family of Old World craftsmen. He studied in Cincinnati and moved to New York City in 1879 to further his education. While there he worked under the direction of William Merritt Chase on landscapes, portraits, and figures. Otto Stark was the only one of the Hoosier Group to study in Paris. Paris in 1885 was awhirl with the dancing light of Impressionism. However, the official schools were intent upon the preservation of traditional art within narrow aesthetic bounds. He attended the Academie Julian as it was a haven for students concerned with the restrictions of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the cost, or unable to pass the entrance examination. While in Paris he studied with Lefebvre, Boulanger, and Cormon. In 1886 he married Marie Nitschelm. After three years in Paris, he and Marie and their one year old son moved to New York City. By 1891 they were the parents of four children. Marie died that same year and Stark brought his children to Indianapolis for his father and sister to care for. He opened a studio in 1894 in Indianapolis where he taught classes in oil and watercolor. In 1894 the Exhibit of Summer Work at the Art Association of Indianapolis by Otto Stark, T. C. Steele, William Forsyth, R.B. Gruelle and Ottis Adams was renamed Five Hoosier Painters and moved to Chicago. The Chicago art critics were warmly receptive to these artists and praised them for their individuality, vitality, and freshness of approach. Consistent with his Impressionistic emphasis on subject matter, Stark's work had been drawn from his everyday experiences of sleeping babies and playing children. Otto Stark was a member of the Manual Training School faculty and later taught at John Herron Art Institute, mostly a Saturday school at that time. He instructed his students to keep drawing paper handy at all times and draw everything - their homes, families, and friends. \"Most people of Indiana don't realize what he did for the art world of Indiana. He inspired all of us to go to New York. He kept abreast of New York, Chicago, and Paris. He had an independent reputation on the East coast.\" quote by Elmer Taflinger, an Indianapolis artist. Only Otto Stark of the Hoosier Group remained devoted to figure painting and he found a way to do it economically. In 1913 he was commissioned to paint two large murals at IPS #60 (9' by 12'). In 1914 he was hired to paint murals at Indianapolis City Hospital - along with Forsyth, Steele, Adams, and others. These artists worked for house painters' wages. It was generally felt their best work was before 1905. They were better painters when working together. His paintings can be found at the Indiana State House, University of Kansas, and Cincinnati Art Museum.",

    "Micro Summary": "\"The Seiner\" by Otto Stark showcases the artist's most Impressionist style, featuring bold colors and broken brushstrokes that reflect his unique training at Paris's Academie Julian rather than the typical Munich influence of his Hoosier Group contemporaries. The painting depicts a local boy, F. Rusterholz, fishing in Indiana's Whitewater River, demonstrating Stark's commitment to figure painting using family and friends as economical models. This experimental work remained unexhibited during Stark's lifetime, making it one of the most adventurous productions among Indiana artists of the period.",

The monumental gilt bronze figure became a popular success and the sculptor made many smaller-scale copies. The IMA's version shows the graceful, idealized lines and naturalistic forms of the Beaux-Arts style that Saint-Gaudens employed for his only nude female figure. The original eighteen-foot figure of Diana was much too cumbersome and unbalanced to remain as a weathervane. A smaller thirteen-foot version was made and placed on the building, where it remained until the structure was demolished and the statue acquired by the Philadelphia Museum of Art.",
    "Artist Biography": "Dublin-native Augustus Saint-Gaudens was raised in New York City after his Irish mother and French father immigrated to America when he was six months old. He took classes at the Cooper Union and the National Academy of Design before traveling to Paris, where he studied at the École des Beaux Arts. He also studied art and architecture in Rome. Upon his return to the United States, Saint-Gaudens received critical acclaim for his monuments commemorating heroes of the American Civil War and his numerous funerary monuments and busts. His colossal Standing Lincoln in Lincoln Park, Chicago, is considered one of the finest portrait statues in America. It was followed by a seated statue of the president in Chicago's Grant Park, a copy of which was placed by Lincoln's tomb. Saint-Gaudens was an important teacher, tutoring privately and at the Art Students League of New York. He is also known for his portrait medallions and coin designs. Later in life, he founded the Cornish Colony in New Hampshire, which attracted numerous painters, architects, and sculptors, including Paul Manship, Thomas Wilmer Dewing, and the illustrator Maxfield Parrish. His house and gardens are preserved as Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site.",

The artist admired the Dutch School of painters who often chose servants as their subject.",
    "Artist Biography": "Paxton was born in Baltimore, Maryland but grew up outside Boston. He set out for Paris when he was only age 20. He studied under the master painter Gerome while in Europe. Upon his return to New England he attended the Boston School and became associated with Tarbell and Benson. Paxton soon became a prominent member of the group. In 1906 Paxton became an Instructor at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He admired such artists as Velasquez, Vermeer and Inges. He also taught his wife Okie Paxton and together they changed the art scene forever. Paxton is known for depicting genteel New England women in well appointed parlors. Writers in the early 20th century admired his technique, the clever brushwork, and the good taste of the group known as the \"Tarbellites. They deplored the emphasis upon elegant accessories, referring to the paintings as \"parlor pictures.\" Our painting Girl Sweeping is an exception from this theory since it shows a domestic servant. However it clearly shows very expensive articles around the room of the owner. Paxton passed away in 1941.",

The light-filled sky reflected in the water may be a metaphor for spiritual and physical harmony. A tiny image of a boat in the center of the lake leaves a trail of ripples in the water. In 1863, Whittredge painted several works, including Lake Shawangunk, which revealed Gifford's influence in their panoramic scope and luminous colors. This canvas captures the crisp atmosphere and color of the Catskills in autumn. It also suggests the Hudson River School's response to pantheism, the belief that the deity is present in every detail of creation. The light-filled sky and its reflection in the smooth river could be viewed as a metaphor of spiritual and physical harmony. In this context, the canoe, poised at the apex of an arrow-shaped wake, may represent man's spiritual aspirations.",
    "Artist Biography": "Worthington Whittredge, as he called himself after 1855, was born on a farm in Springfield, Ohio. He moved to Cincinnati in 1837, worked with his brother-in-law as a house painter, and taught himself to paint portraits and landscapes. He experimented with daguerreotypes in Indianapolis, opened a portrait studio in Charlestown, West Virginia, and then returned to Cincinnati. From 1843 on, he devoted himself to landscapes. Through the efforts of wealthy Cincinnati art patron Nicholas Longworth, Whittredge was able to study for five years in Düsseldorf, Germany. He also spent five years in Rome before returning to the United States in 1859. Whittredge settled in New York City, where he opened a studio. He experienced some difficulty adapting his European skills to the American scene. The quality of light seemed different to Whittredge, who was accustomed to the frequently overcast skies of central Germany. His search for an American style was aided by the example of Sanford Gifford, whom he had known in Düsseldorf and Rome.",

Duveneck absorbed the basic principles of the Munich Academy's teaching – strong brushwork and the manipulation of dark color tonalities, - but he later developed his own ideas, drawn from the practices of French Barbizon artists. This influence appears in Polling Landscape in the simple composition with its sketch-like quality.

He returned to Europe and opened an art school in Munich and Polling in Bavaria where he trained Americans who became known as the \"Duveneck Boys.\" He also opened a studio in Italy and spent winters in Florence and summers in Venice. His painting began to change from the dark interiors of his Munich style to the brighter palette of Impressionism, but much of his work continued to exhibit the style of his Munich training.

Use of wood grain paint on canvas to appear to be wood. Haberle's deteriorating eyesight forced him to give up painting.",
    "Artist Biography": "John Haberle was an American painter and lithographer, born in New Haven, Connecticut in 1856. He was the son of German immigrants and was apprenticed to a lithographer at the age of 14 and earned his livelihood in that field. His only formal training was at the National Academy of Design in 1884. He then founded the New Haven Sketch Club, gave art lessons and was active in art circles until about 1910. In the 1880's he worked for the Peabody Museum at Yale University, drawing illustrations for its publications. Haberle began to practice trompe l'oeil painting, a popular art form in America after the Civil War. He was unique in the precision of his trompe l'oeil in their subtle irony and wit. His work was so precise that one Chicago art critic accused Haberle of deception-of gluing objects to the canvas instead of painting them. Haberle's paintings are highly personal, with subtle meanings and visual puns. His work was ignored by the artistic establishment who thought his subject matter too commonplace. Haberle died in obscurity but his work was rediscovered in the 1950's by A. Frankenstein.",

    "Artist Biography": "Cecilia Beaux (1855-1942) was one of the most successful American portrait painters of her generation. She studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and in Paris. Beaux was the first woman to teach at the Pennsylvania Academy and received numerous prestigious commissions. She was highly respected in her time and compared favorably to John Singer Sargent.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Beaux was one of the most successful women artists of her era, breaking barriers to teach at the Pennsylvania Academy. Her portraits were sought after by prominent families and she received commissions comparable to those given to male artists like Sargent. She combined technical mastery with psychological insight in her portraiture.",
    "Connections": "Compare with other society portraits. Discuss Beaux's achievement as a woman artist in a male-dominated field. Note similarities and differences with Sargent's approach to portraiture. Connect to other portraits by women artists like Taggart.",
    "Sources/Bibliography": "Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts records. Documentation of Beaux's career and commissions.",
    "Micro Summary": "Beaux's portrait of Mrs. Addison C. Harris showcases the sophisticated technique that made her one of America's most successful portrait painters, often compared to John Singer Sargent. As the first woman instructor at Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Beaux broke gender barriers while securing prestigious commissions from prominent families. Her work combines technical mastery learned in Paris with psychological insight, capturing subjects in moments of thoughtful repose.",

    "Collection": "American Painting & Sculpture 1800–1945",
    "Date": "1910",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "This painting focuses on a single female, and the play of light suggests calmness and serenity despite the 'busyness' of the surroundings – fabric patterns and dappled light. You get the feeling that you're looking in on a quiet, intimate, reflective moment. This is one of two versions of the same subject. The other painting is entitled Morning – Yellow Room, and it is at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Frieseke maintained that the light in the same location was always discernibly different depending on the time of day and the season of the year. The model used here is his wife. In later paintings his daughter, Frances – the light of his life – was often his subject.",
    "Artist Biography": "Frederick Carl Frieseke was born in Owosso, Michigan, in 1874. Evidence of his early interest in art was noted in that he often drew in the margins of his school books. Although he studied for short periods at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Art Students League in New York, and Academie Julian in Paris, Frieseke called himself a self-taught artist. He made no preparatory sketches of his work and took his inspiration for the picture straight to the canvas. In France he lived next door to Claude Monet, and he was considered the founder of the Giverny Group. Other members of the group were Richard E. Miller, Lawton Parker, Guy Rose, Edmund Greacen and Karl Anderson. They were sometimes referred to as the Giverny Luminists, and they found their Impressionist approach a liberation from the academic restraints of subject and style which was prevalent at the time. Frieseke's work is identified by his signature style: a single, voluptuous female figure (often nude) in colorful, intimate setting of dappled sunlight. He also had a strong predilection for decorative pattern, texture and accessories. His large, rounded women show the influence of Auguste Renoir. There are three identifiable periods of Frieseke's work: Early Period (Paris to Giverny – 1897 – 1905): Academic style and tonal approach show the influence of James McNeill Whistler. Giverny Period (1905 – 1920): Looser brushstrokes and lighter palette celebrating light, color and the female form evidence the Impressionist style. Normandy Period (1920 – 1939): His final stage shows a return to tonalist style with a more realistic approach and more restrained use of decorative pattern.",
    "Tour Guidance": "For Primary Tours: Women – Look at artists' depictions featuring a lone women in an intimate or isolated setting such as Afternoon Tea by Richard Miller, Dorothy by William Merritt Chase, Sunlight by Frank Benson, Red Kimono on the Roof by John Sloan, Tidying Up by Isabel Bishop, and Preparing for the Matinee by Edward Charles Tarbell. Sunlight – Look at treatment of sunlight in works such as The House of the Deaf Woman and the Belfry at Eragny by Camille Pissarro, Afternoon Tea by Richard Miller, and Sunlight by Frank Benson. For other tours: Compare Frieseke's rounded women with other similar renderings – Young Girls by Mary Cassatt or Tidying Up by Isabel Bishop. Contrast this setting with other renderings of women from other painting styles such as the unadorned background of Dorothy by William Merritt Chase, the loneliness of Hotel Lobby by Edward Hopper, or the candor of Mrs. MacDowell by Henry Raeburn.",
    "Connections": "Afternoon Tea by Richard Miller – This painting was done by one of Frieseke's contemporaries in the Giverny Group. Sunlight by Frank Benson – This painting too is distinguished by the artist's interpretation of sunlight and its play both on the landscape and on the subject.",

    "Micro Summary": "Frederick C. Frieseke's \"Afternoon – Yellow Room\" depicts a serene female figure, modeled by his wife, in an intimate domestic setting filled with patterned fabrics and dappled light. The painting captures a quiet, reflective moment that conveys calmness despite the visual complexity of the surroundings. This work is one of two versions exploring the same subject, with its companion piece \"Morning – Yellow Room\" housed at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Frieseke was particularly interested in how light changed throughout different times of day and seasons, demonstrating this fascination through these paired paintings.",

    "Date": "1883",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "The Bacidae was part of a series of salon pictures. It shows two priestesses of Baccis, a noted soothsayer, who studied the entrails of birds to make his predictions. Haruspices, or haruspex in singular form, are people seasoned to carry out a type of divination known as Haruspicy. Haruspicy is a divination that uses natural phenomenon such as lightning and this practice also uses the internal organs or innards of animal sacrifices. Haruspices examine intestines and livers of, mostly but not restricted to, sheep and poultry. Another term for Haruspicy is Extispicy. The painting represents an old priestess initiating a new (and alarmed) member of the order. This large canvas was exhibited at the 1883 Paris Salon. Dodson received praise for her technique, which was described as \"virile in color and draftsmanship, powerful without exaggeration, masculine without straining.\" The Bacidae became the artist's best-known work.",
    "Artist Biography": "Sarah Dodson started drawing at the age of three, making pictures of stories told to her by her family. Her father, who himself was an illustrator an engraver and portraitist, did not approve of this hobby. So, she did not study art until after his death in 1872. She attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts but spent most of her life in Europe, painting religious and historical subjects as well as landscapes. It was difficult for women to establish themselves as professional painters, but Dodson exhibited several times in the Salons of Paris and Munich as well as in her hometown of Philadelphia.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Q1: When you think of Greece and the contributions of the Greeks to the arts, literature, and science do you think of divination as a major Greek culture contribution? Why do you think Sarah Dodson chose this subject? Q2: Today with 24/7 news cycle who would some say are the soothsayers? Q3: Sarah Dodson was devoted to her art; she did not marry and have a family. As you look at the young woman in the painting do you get the sense that SD is projecting herself as a woman artist in the late 1800's?",

Exhibited at the 1883 Paris Salon to critical acclaim, this ambitious historical painting showcases Dodson's ability to navigate the male-dominated art world of the late 19th century while exploring themes of female knowledge transmission and ancient spiritual practices.",

The unspoiled wilderness becomes both a haven for spiritual contemplation and a Promised Land to be settled by the pioneers. Durand was a leader of the Hudson River School. Landscape with Covered Wagon displays a compositional type favored by Thomas Cole in his more allegorical works. Despite its obvious emphasis on nature, the painting is a metaphor for the young nation, illustrating the popular theme of immigrants confronting the New World. On the left is the primeval forest, often interpreted as both an untamed realm and a haven for contemplation by American philosophers and poets such as William Cullen Bryant. The right side shows the New Eden, the proverbial Promised Land, the place for future pioneer settlement.",
    "Artist Biography": "Asher Brown Durand was born in Maplewood, New Jersey (known then as Jefferson Village). He was apprenticed to an engraver, eventually becoming part owner of the firm. He engraved Declaration of Independence for John Trumbull in 1823, which established Durand's reputation as a printmaker. Durand was a founding member of the National Academy of Design. His interest in oil painting began around 1830 with the encouragement of his patron, Luman Reed. In 1837, Durand accompanied his friend and colleague Thomas Cole on a sketching expedition to Schroon Lake in the Adirondacks, which increased his interest in becoming a landscape painter. He spent summers sketching in the Catskills, Adirondacks, and the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Durand was a strong advocate for drawing directly from nature in a truthful manner. He became the leader of the Hudson River School after the death of its founder Thomas Cole.",

Guy may have acquired his polished style by copying the paintings of seventeenth-century Dutch masters in London.

    "Artwork Description": "James Montgomery Flagg created this painting of Hoosier author Booth Tarkington in just one day--August 19, 1916-- during a visit to Tarkington's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Tarkington discussed the \"zip-bang portrait\" in a letter (transcribed below) to his friend Julian Street written the day after the portrait session. Tarkington was impressed with Flagg's lyrical use of color and his ability to capture Tarkington's spirit-- his \"almost vicious mental energy\"-- in such a brief sitting. Tarkington lightly pokes fun at \"critic stuff\" in the letter to Street, but his interest in art was deep. He was an art collector himself, and he was a trustee and supporter of the John Herron Art Institute, forerunner of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Tarkington and Street worked together with producer George C. Tyler from 1915 to 1917 on their co-authored play \"The Country Cousin,\" which Tarkington discusses toward the end of the letter (where he refers to Tyler as \"G.C.T.\"). Their play finally opened at the Gaiety Theater in New York in September 1917.",

    "Sources/Bibliography": "Booth Tarkingto's letter to Julian Street (from the Julian Street Papers, Princeton University Library) Aug 20 '16 Dear Julian: – Flagg came over yesterday and painted the most zip-bang portrait of a Nawthur—me. Darn ugly messy-faced chap sitting in great concentration at littered desk—summer clothes—author's body slouching down inside 'em—lazy body with almost vicious mental energy showing in the eyes. Homely as the feller is, the picture is beautiful—color managed so that a \"lyric\" (critic stuff) quality is there as much as if it were the portrait of some lovely woman. It's one of these things you stand before & say, \"Holy Mike, but he has done it!\" Altogether Flagg's too as distinctively as his house, his car and his nose. He beats the devil—here's a one-day job that's ready for any gallery— Did G.C.T. send you new script? He seems altogether pleased—thinks plum right; peruse his note after reading & deduce. Be careful to read it as a thing played—The new type \"Nancy\" is to be just the least bit puzzling in earlier scenes with \"George\"—perhaps she affects her naïveté: She does, in fact. N.B.T.",

He studied in more conservative Parisian academies before turning to the progressive Impressionist idiom. Frieseke was the leader of the Giverny Group, which included American Impressionists, who lived in close proximity to Claude Monet. His garden villa at Giverny is the setting for most of his works depicting women at leisure, either seated in gardens or in sun rooms. According to Frieseke's own statement, he painted directly on the canvas without the aid of preliminary sketches.",

    "Artist Biography": "Born in Newburgh, NY in 1825, died while traveling in Scotland, 1894. George Inness was born in Newburgh, NY into a successful family where his father was a grocer. The fifth of 13 children, Inness received his first artistic training with an itinerant artist, John Jesse Barker. Later, he apprenticed to work as an engraver in New York. More significant was his study with Regis-Francois Gignoux, a landscape painter, who introduced him to the works of the European master, specifically, Claude Lorrain. Inness traveled to Europe where he was greatly influenced by the Barbizon painters during his travels to France. Upon returning to America, Inness moved from New York, home of Hudson River School, to Medfield, MA where he could live in isolation and practice the loosely structured composition and rustic themes along with the sketch-like brushwork of the Barbizon. In the mid-1860s, he was introduced to the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Swedenborgianism believes that all material objects are spiritually charged and that everything exists in both the earthly and spiritual realm. His belief in the Swedenborgianism ideals are evident in his painting, that, unlike the Hudson River School, do not imitate nature, but are infused with soft vibrating colors and gauzy paint surfaces. Inness was a member of the Society of American Artists and was widely exhibited in his life.",

    "Micro Summary": "\"The Rainbow\" by George Inness (1825-1894) depicts a dramatic landscape scene following a storm, with religious and spiritual undertones reflecting the artist's Swedenborgian beliefs that objects exist in both physical and spiritual realms. The painting contrasts the danger and renewal of nature through the juxtaposition of dark storm clouds and the hopeful rainbow, while incorporating symbolic elements like cows and birds that align with his spiritual philosophy. Inness uses dramatic lighting and strategic placement of white to guide the viewer's eye through the composition, creating a romantic atmosphere that explores humanity's relationship with nature. The work also subtly addresses the impact of industrialization on the natural landscape, visible through hints of industry in the background.",

    "Artwork Description": "This painting's introspective mood, harmonious colors and peaceful, open scene are prime examples of American Tonalism. The artist wanted his lanscapes to be evocations of states of mind.Tryon's favorite subject was a stand of trees in a barren field at twilight. Tryon's favorite subject was a stand of trees in a barren field at twilight or just after sunrise. November Morning is lighter in color and freer in execution than most of his treatments of this motif. While it may be reminiscent of Impressionist landscapes, such as Monet's scenes of poplar trees, the intentions of the two artists were radically different. Tryon despised the naturalism of the Impressionists, as his landscapes are evocations of states of mind rather than depictions of nature. Such landscapes are examples of Tonalism, a style in which muted colors and peaceful, open scenes create introspective moods. In keeping with this attitude, Tryon composed his paintings in his studio from memory. With their subtle color harmonies and sense of gentle melancholy, Tryon's works are prime examples of American Tonalism. After 1890, Impressionism began to displace the Barbizon aesthetic in America, and it was inevitable that the two schools should eventually affect each other. Whether intentional or not, November Morning reflects the influence of Impressionism",
    "Artist Biography": "Dwight Tryon was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and displayed his artistic talent at an early age. He was forced to defer an art career to support his widowed mother. While working in a bookstore, he began painting scenes along the Connecticut River. He went to France with his wife in 1876 to study art at the École des Beaux Arts and spent the summer in the village of Barbizon, where he was inspired by the area's quiet pastoral landscape. After returning to America, Tryon opened a summer studio in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, in 1883. His paintings from this period are twilight and evening scenes executed in a manner that was influenced by the Barbizon School. His palette changed in the 1890s, as he employed soft, luminous, and bright colors. Tryon became director of the Art School at Smith College and was instrumental in developing their art collection.",

His style changed from the panoramic landscapes of his youth to the \"controlled atmospheres\" of his mature work. A deeply religious man, Inness followed the teachings of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, who theorized that objects in the material world have correspondences in a parallel realm of the spirit. In the latter part of his life, Inness spent much time at Tarpon Springs, Florida, where he maintained a winter home, Rose Villa, and a studio, which he spoke of as a \"loft.\"",

Brook in Summer is probably a composite of sketches of the Indianapolis countryside and views invented by Cox.

Cox varies the format of the traditional landscape by placing the trees, bushes and fallen branches randomly, as they appear in nature, rather than in an idealized order. This setting is probably a composite of sketches of the Indianapolis countryside and views invented by Cox.",
    "Artist Biography": "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in separate ferry accidents. Cox's grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians. By that time the young Cox was already interested in art. He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis. The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time. By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox's business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design. Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire. When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers. He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.",

At seventeen, his father sent him abroad to study at the Dusseldorf Academy. He also studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He became an expatriate when he lived in Egmond, Holland, for sixteen years, sharing a studio with the American artist George Hitchcock. The people of Holland inspired his work and were his primary subjects. In 1909, he settled in Weimer, Germany, but returned to America at the start of World War I. Melchers made his home at \"Belmont,\" near Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he continued to paint in a naturalist style mingled with Impressionism, using thick impasto, a bright palette, and strong colors. Melchers was interested in depicting the ordinary lives of average people, but he also painted peasants as biblical figures in contemporary settings.",

    "Artist Biography": "Frederic Edwin Church is known as one of America's great landscape painters, bridging the era of the pioneering Hudson River Romantics and the late nineteenth century painters of the American West. The only pupil of Thomas Cole, with whom he studied from 1844-1846, the precocious Church was immediately successful and a full member of the National Academy of Design by the age of 24. He acquired an interest in the importance of nature as a force in itself, abandoning his teacher's allegories for a transcendentalist vision of both the North and the South American landscape. The writings and example of the great naturalist Baron von Humboldt helped direct Church both to new world subjects and a dramatic but naturalistic view of nature. Church later traveled through Europe, the Middle East and even to the Arctic, and his large-scale depictions of exotic locales made him one of the most successful artists in the country in the third quarter of the century. He lived in New York until his beloved Hudson River castle, Olana, was completed in the mid-70s and the majority of his later paintings are based on the scenery of that area and Northern New England. The artist's brushstroke also evolved through the years: an early painterliness was gradually replaced by a smoother surface, and the contours and edges assumed a more pronounced definition. Nevertheless, many of Church's landscapes retain all the emotional quality of Cole at his most dramatic and heroic.",

The painting serves as a powerful symbol of Church's unwavering faith in the Union's ultimate victory during the American Civil War. Through this dramatic composition, Church presents the flag as an enduring beacon of hope and determination, suggesting that the Union cause will prevail despite the ongoing conflict.",

At a distance, the choppy strokes and daubs of color resolve into a luminous floral landscape. Painted in France in 1888, this canvas is one of the earliest American responses to French Impressionism. During his second stay in France, Vonnoh painted Poppies, which is related to a large canvas of poppy fields in Flanders from the same year. Because of their intense hues, poppies were a favorite subject of the French Impressionists. Vonnoh's depiction of a poppy field in France gives the effect of having been painted quickly and directly before the subject. With no horizon or path for the eye to follow out of the foreground, Vonnoh's landscape seems to pitch forward, emphasizing the two-dimensional surface of the canvas. At a distance, the choppy strokes and daubs of pigment resolve into a luminous picture that incorporates the Impressionist techniques of broken brushwork and complementary colors. Poppies is one of the earliest paintings by an American Impressionist to rival the work of the French Impressionists.",
    "Artist Biography": "Robert Vonnoh may not be one of America's best-known Impressionist painters, but he was the first American artist to bring Impressionism to this country. Born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1858, Vonnoh moved to Boston in his youth. He taught William Glackens, Robert Henri, and John Sloan, who became part of the group known as the Ashcan School. Vonnoh made numerous trips to France, first to study at the Académie Julian and later to settle in the area of Grèz-sur-Loing, near the Forest of Fontainebleau. Numerous paintings created in France were displayed at the Paris Salon. He also had a one-man show at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and he was principal instructor in portrait and landscape painting at the Academy from 1891 to 1894. During his career, Vonnoh was considered one of the foremost landscape and portrait painters in America. For twenty-five years, he was part of the artists' colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut.",

With thick strokes of the brush, Weir suggested the textures of porcelain, fabric, and food and created a straightforward composition remarkably close in spirit to works of 19th-century French realists.

    "Artist Biography": "J. Alden Weir was the youngest of 16 children of the artist Robert W. Weir. The younger Weir's art education began with training from his father. At 18, he enrolled at the National Academy School in New York and then studied in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. Weir began working directly from nature and soon came under the influence of French Impressionism. In the 1880s Weir focused on still-life painting along with landscape. He favored floral studies painted with a dark palette, which did not reflect his interest in Impressionism. Weir was also a portrait painter and married one of his models. He had a New York studio and supported himself with portrait painting and teaching. Weir became associated with the American Impressionists Childe Hassam and John Twachtman and was a founding member of the Society of American Artists, who rebelled against the strict academic standards of the National Academy of Design. Weir joined with his colleagues to form the Ten American Painters, a stylistically diverse organization usually identified with American Impressionism. Weir was one of the organizers of the 1913 Armory show in New York, which introduced avant-garde European art to the American public.",

    "Date": "about 1907",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "Twinkling lights on the distant shore mixed with dark tonal harmonies create a moody twilight landscape. The expressive, linear brushwork may have been derived from the study of Asian painting. Dabo described his landscapes as \"pretexts for beautiful color arrangements.\" Dabo described his landscapes as \"pretexts for beautiful color arrangements.\" In Rondout, New York, the dark tonal harmonies and subject matter recall Whistler's paintings of the Thames. Dabo's calligraphic brushwork of the trees, boats, and figures may have their source in his study of Asian painting. In this moody twilight view, Dabo took full advantage of the steely gray expanse of the Hudson River at Rondout Creek near Kingston, New York. Lights on the distant shore begin to twinkle, as daylight surrenders to nightfall.",
    "Artist Biography": "Leon Dabo was born in France to Ignace Schott, who was an artist, collector, and instructor of aesthetics. He grew up in Detroit, Michigan, trained under his father, and then relocated to New York City, where he met painter and muralist John La Farge. Dabo studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs, Académie Julian, and the École des Beaux Arts. He made numerous visits to James Abbott McNeill Whistler in his London studio. Many of his paintings reflect Whistler's influence in their Tonalist style and in the use of a monogram signature. Dabo became an authority on Whistler. When he returned to New York City, Dabo painted decorative works and murals. He also painted Whistlerian landscapes and seascapes.",

    "Micro Summary": "Leon Dabo's \"Rondout, New York\" depicts a moody twilight scene along the Hudson River at Rondout Creek near Kingston, capturing the transition from day to night with twinkling lights on the distant shore. The artist employs dark tonal harmonies and expressive, calligraphic brushwork that reflects his study of Asian painting techniques. Dabo viewed his landscapes as \"pretexts for beautiful color arrangements,\" and this work demonstrates his ability to transform the steely gray expanse of the river into an atmospheric composition reminiscent of Whistler's Thames paintings. The linear brushwork defining trees, boats, and figures enhances the contemplative quality of this nightfall scene.",

    "Artwork Description": "The tonal harmonies are reminiscent of French Barbizon landscapes. Areas of strong sunlight peek through the dense forest illuminating the rocks and the girl's dress. While summering in Vermont in 1887, Steele painted a series of forest interiors similar to this work. A June Idyll was painted during Steele's summer sojourn as a guest of Allen M. Fletcher, secretary-treasurer of the Indianapolis Natural Gas Company, at the Fletcher family home in Vermont. The artist divided his summer work in Vermont between expansive views of the Green Mountains and a series of small forest interiors, several of which included the artist's family. In this painting Steele's daughter Daisy is reading to her brother Shirley beneath a shade tree. The tonal harmonies reflect the artist's interest in French Barbizon landscapes. Areas of strong sunlight peek through the dense forest, illuminating the rocks and the girl's dress. Daisy's bright red hat offers a dramatic dash of color amid the lush green grass.",
    "Artist Biography": "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana. His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve. By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. In 1873 Steele moved to Indianapolis, where he painted portraits and exhibited paintings at an art supply store owned by Herman Lieber, who became an important friend and patron. Lieber headed efforts to send Steele and his family to Europe, gathering twelve subscribers to sponsor the artist's study in exchange for paintings. Following a precedent set by James Gookins and William M. Chase from Indiana and Frank Duveneck of Cincinnati, Steele went to Germany to study at Royal Academy of Art in Munich, a city with the added benefit of being more affordable than Paris. Steele studied in Munich 1880-1885 and after returning to Indianapolis, established the Indiana School of Art, where William Forsyth taught. The Art Association of Indianapolis (precursor to the IMA) took control of the school in 1891. Steele painted portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School. As he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting. His work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic, particularly after he saw European Impressionist paintings at the 1893 Chicago World Columbian Exposition. Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana's most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle. In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco. In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds. For the remainder of his life, he painted the surrounding landscape in his personal variation on Impressionism.",

    "Artwork Description": "Oil painting created in 1903, depicting 15-year-old Margaret MacKittrick, a friend of Thayer's children. The model recalled posing while Mrs. Thayer read to her to alleviate boredom. The idealized portrait shows a young woman, part innocence and part sensuality, inspired by Whistler's series of similar subjects. Features an elaborate Renaissance frame possibly inspired by architect Stanford White, which elevates the portrait from ordinary to exceptional.",
    "Artist Biography": "Abbott Handerson Thayer (1849-1921) was an American artist known for idealized portraits and his scientific work on animal camouflage. He suffered from bipolar disorder with continuous manic manifestations and deep depressions. Living with him became increasingly difficult, and when his wife Emma moved into a hotel, he came close to suicide. He died in 1921 after suffering a series of strokes.",

Working while Mrs. Thayer read to the model, the artist employed soft Impressionist brushwork and Tonalist palette despite struggling with bipolar disorder. The psychological complexity of Thayer's mental state contrasts with the serene idealization of his subject.",

    "Artwork Description": "Ritman painted in a fluid, Impressionist manner often with an abundance of patterns and a degree of abstraction. Patterning is evident in the subject's robe, draperies and bedspread which contrast with the abstract appearance of the garden beyond the window. Ritman painted portraits and still lifes but his favorite subjects were often artfully posed female models in interiors illuminated with bright natural light. He often used thick, divisionistic daubs of bright paint. Early Morning Sunshine portrays a pensive young woman, possibly his favorite model, Mimi, sitting on an open window ledge with a vibrant abstract garden outside the window. The table setting of a bowl of fruit and china pieces is actually a still-life painting within the overall painting. Brilliant morning light illuminates this painting which was created using broken brushstrokes, with a harmonious balance of blues, pinks, lavenders and yellow.",
    "Artist Biography": "American Impressionist painter and professor of painting; born 1889 in Kaments-Podolsky, Russia; emigrated to America in early 1900s, settling in Chicago; died 1963, Winona, Minn. Ritman received early artistic training in Chicago and Philadelphia followed by studies beginning in 1909 at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the Academie Julian in Paris. In 1911 he met fellow American painter, Frederick Frieseke, who invited him to join other American painters in Giverny, France, where Ritman was greatly influenced by their work and that of Claude Monet. Ritman painted each summer in Giverny until 1930 after which time he accepted the position of Professor of Painting at the Art Institute of Chicago which he held for the next 30 years.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Use as part of American Impressionic Painting comparing works by Frederick Frieiseke, and Richard E Miller and others. Discuss the painting technique used – type of brushstrokes, use of color, patterning, abstraction, fluidity. What is the time of day portrayed in this work? What is the subject doing and what is the atmosphere of the painting? Discuss how American Impressionism is similar to and different from French Impressionism – structure, realism, subject matter, painting technique.",
    "Connections": "Compare with other American Impressionists and with other artists who use light in their works (Turrell, Irwin, Benson and others). Compare use of light in Ritman paintings with Tarbell's Preparing for the Matinee. Where is Tarbell's light emanating from? Note the Impressionistic style of brushstrokes in the woman's blouse and hair. Contrast with Red Kimono on the Roof (John Sloan) and Girl Sweeping (Paxton) - how women are portrayed, what they are doing, setting, colors, etc. Compare the Giverny Group with other American Impressionists who did not paint in France.",

    "Date": "1884",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "The young woman in Steele's canvas represents a departure from the Royal Academy's preference for older models. This attractive figure, whose youthful facial features emerge from the dark shadows, is rendered in brown tonalities against an unadorned, dark background. The setting and execution exemplify the austere style espoused by Germany's Royal Academy teachers. Steele's painting instructor Ludwig Löfftz was prone to severe criticism of the \"sweet color\" in his students' work and praised such somber and meditative images as Munich Girl.",
    "Artist Biography": "T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana. His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art classes at age twelve. By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland Collegiate Institute. In 1873 Steele moved to Indianapolis, where he painted portraits and exhibited paintings at an art supply store owned by Herman Lieber, who became an important friend and patron. Lieber headed efforts to send Steele and his family to Europe, gathering twelve subscribers to sponsor the artist's study in exchange for paintings. Following a precedent set by James Gookins and William M. Chase from Indiana and Frank Duveneck of Cincinatti, Steele went to Germany to study at Royal Academy of Art in Munich, a city with the added benefit of being more affordable than Paris. Steele studied in Munich 1880-1885 and after returning to Indianapolis, established the Indiana School of Art, where William Forsyth taught. The Art Association of Indianapolis (precursor to the IMA) took control of the school in 1891. Steele painted portraits and landscapes, many of them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School. As he began to explore the Indiana countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting. His work became more colorful and gradually more impressionistic, particularly after he saw European Impressionist paintings at the 1893 Chicago World Columbian Exposition. Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana's most important Impressionist painters, including William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle. In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco. In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home that became known as the House of the Singing Winds. For the remainder of his life, he painted the surrounding landscape in his personal variation on Impressionism.",

    "Micro Summary": "T.C. Steele's \"Munich Girl\" depicts a young woman rendered in brown tones against a dark, unadorned background, representing a departure from the Royal Academy's typical preference for older models. The painting exemplifies the austere style taught at Germany's Royal Academy, where Steele studied under Ludwig Löfftz. The somber, meditative composition reflects Löfftz's teaching philosophy, which criticized \"sweet color\" in favor of such restrained, shadowy works. The young woman's facial features emerge from dark shadows, creating a contemplative mood characteristic of the German academic tradition.",

    "Artwork Description": "Indianapolis native William Scott studied in France with the celebrated African American artist Henry O. Tanner. Etaples, Tanner's summer residence, was the subject of several of Scott's paintings. Tanner's influence is evident in the blue-green palette, subdued tonality and dramatic light. A few years later, Scott depicted the area around Tanner's home in Rainy Night, Étaples. Tanner's influence is evident in the painting's blue-green palette, subdued tonality, and dramatic lighting. The loosely brushed, spontaneous composition demonstrates the restrained impressionist technique that dominated Scott's European work. The building in the painting was identified as the town hall in Étaples, France.",
    "Artist Biography": "Indianapolis native William Edouard Scott was a graduate of Emmerich Manual Training High School and briefly attended Saturday school at the John Herron Art Institute. He became the first African American to teach in the Indianapolis Public Schools. He studied first at the Art Institute of Chicago and then, in France. Though a versatile painter, Scott was primarily known as a muralist. His murals can be found in numerous buildings, including schools, government buildings, funeral homes, and churches. He traveled to Haiti to paint the region. Shortly after Scott arrived in France in 1909, the celebrated African American expatriate artist, Henry Ossawa Tanner, invited him to stay at his summer home in Normandy.",

    "Artwork Description": "Souvenir of the Columbian Exposition is only one of two known works by Atkinson. It exemplifies the illusionism of trompe l'oeil (French for \"Fool-the-eye\") paintings, using oil on canvas to create the effect of wood grain or a paper postcard. This kind of still life subject, sometimes called a \"letter rack\" picture, originated in seventeenth century Holland and was revived by several nineteenth century artists working in Philadelphia, including William Harnett, James Peto, and several members of the Peale family. This painting is a document of one of the most important events in the history of American culture, the World's Columbian Exposition, which was held in Chicago in 1893. The stamp and letters, apt subject matter for a mail carrier, all relate to this exposition. An envelope addressed to \"Mr. John Smith Philada Pa\" is stamped \"Due 1¢\" and bears the commemorative stamp of \"Columbus in Sight of Land\" (one cent) mailed from Kensington Station, Philadelphia. This is pasted over an embossed Columbian envelope, which reads \"Columbia Station October 4 2PM Philadelphia.\" Beneath these are two postcards: an \"Official Souvenir Postal\" of the fair and posted from \"World's Fair Station October 24.\" Fascinated by the Exposition and influenced by his job, Atkinson created a skillful souvenir of this important event.",
    "Artist Biography": "Jacob Atkinson, a Philadelphia letter carrier, painted more as a hobby than a profession. He chose to depict still life subjects of mail and money for amusement. Atkinson was a veteran of the Civil War. After the war, jobs in the postal service were often given to veterans. It is not known how many works Atkinson painted or whether he exhibited or sold any of his paintings during his lifetime.",

    "Micro Summary": "Jacob Atkinson's \"Souvenir of the Columbian Exposition\" is a trompe l'oeil oil painting that creates the illusion of actual paper items through masterful technique. The work depicts stamps, letters, and postcards all related to the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, arranged in the \"letter rack\" style popularized by 17th-century Dutch artists and revived by 19th-century Philadelphia painters. As one of only two known works by Atkinson, who worked as a mail carrier, this painting serves as both a skillful artistic achievement and a historical document of one of America's most important cultural events. The realistic rendering includes details like a commemorative Columbus stamp and official fair postcards, reflecting the artist's fascination with the Exposition and his postal profession.",

Although Chase often included his family in his tranquil Shinnecock scenes, First Touch of Autumn presents an expansive view of an unpeopled landscape, which is soft and rolling. Chase captures the vastness of this lowland country as it stretches toward the sea under a clear blue sky.",

He maintained a summer home and studio at Shinnecock Hills on the eastern end of Long Island, where he established America's first summer school of art in 1891. In his classes and in his own artistic production of this period, Chase focused primarily on painting en plein air. Some of Chase's finest and most impressionistic landscapes were painted during his summer sojourns at Shinnecock.",

    "Artist Biography": "Debt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life. Born in North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took him to Scotland, but his mentor's death forced Stuart back to America. During the Revolutionary War, he returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West. As success came, so did debt which forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important political figures. One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the \"Athenaeum Head\" currently on the dollar bill.",

    "Micro Summary": "Gilbert Stuart's \"Portrait of a Family\" depicts a woman and children arranged against a draped backdrop in the British portraiture tradition. The composition uses a unified color palette of similar tones in the sash, chair, curtain, and boy's jacket trim to guide the viewer's eye across all figures. The woman wears an elegant robe à l'anglaise gown popular with portrait painters of the era, while her hair is styled in the fashionable coiffure à l'hérisson or \"hedgehog\" style, featuring lightly powdered hair that is cut short in front, frizzed, and brushed upward from the face.",

    "Artwork Description": "Painting is oil on masonite; preparing masonite requires many coats of gesso and is a laborious process. Bishop and Reginald Marsh, known as the Fourteenth Street School, sought to capture contemporary life in New York City in the 1930s and '40s. Bishop concentrated on the subtleties of fleeting moments of people who lived in and around Union Square- secretaries, sales clerks, blue-collar workers, derelicts. This gave these simple occasions a sense of timelessness—ex. shop girls seated at a lunch counter, talking, putting on makeup. Her subject matter was frequently women, showing them in a positive light of strength. She saw working women as participants in an American tradition of social advancement. Considered an American Scene and Realist painter and also referred to as a humanist painter. The woman, perhaps a secretary or salesperson, uses a pocket mirror to check her teeth for lipstick smudges. It is not posed, more like an informal snapshot. She uses active brushwork and a sense of the figure's physical movement as metaphors for this social advancement. Bishop's sepia tones achieve a transparency that results in a sense of vibration and thus of motion. This warm brown also recalls old master drawings of the Italian Renaissance.",
    "Artist Biography": "American born in 1902 in Cincinnati; died 1988 New York City. She was an American painter, draftsman and etcher. Bishop moved to New York in 1918 to study at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. After reading about the exciting development in modern art, she transferred to the Art Students League in 1920 and studied under Guy Pene du Bois and Kenneth Hayes Miller. During these years she developed lifelong friendship with Reginald Marsh, Edwin Dickinson and other figurative painters who lived and worked on 14th Street. She was influenced by Dutch and Flemish painters such as Adriaen Brouwer and Peter Paul Rubens, whose work she saw in Europe in 1931. She chose to emulate Rubens because the technique and composition of his work expressed the quality of movement she sought. Her mother had worked to secure the vote for women in 1920 and urged Bishop and her sisters toward the independence she had lost once she started her family. While Bishop desired independence it was a wealthy male relative that made it possible for her to attend these schools. He supplied her economic needs for many years. She saw, in this instance, being a woman was to her advantage as he probably would not have subsidized a boy. Bishop worked out of her studio on Union Square in New York City for at least 50 years. Throughout her long career Bishop concentrated on the subtleties of fleeting moments in the daily routine of people who lived and worked around Union Square, giving these simple occasions a sense of timelessness: shop girls seated at a lunch counter, travelers waiting on a subway platform, tramps gathered under the horse's tail of the equestrian statue of George Washington, students walking quietly through the park, and children at play. Her favorite subject matter was women going about their everyday lives, eating, talking, putting on makeup, taking off their coats. These ordinary motions produced facial expressions that Bishop felt revealed the personality of the people she portrayed. She was described as a Urban Realist and an American Scene painter, also one of America's leading humanist painters. Although women figured prominently in the work of both Miller and Marsh, Bishop's work is unique in its sensitivity to women's strength. Bishop saw women as participants in an American tradition of upward mobility, and she used active brushwork and a sense of the figure's physical movement as metaphors for this social advancement. She was friends with many women artists of her century, Louise Nevelson for one, but her fellow male students would be the major influences. Bishop worked in a cautious and painstaking manner, often spending a year or more on a single picture and thus producing fewer than 175 paintings over a period of nearly 60 years. She was compulsive to 'get it right'. Her work has always been widely admired by other artists.",

    "Artwork Description": "Bacchante is a priestess of the God of Wine. A faun normally is a human with the legs and horns of a goat. Fashioned after the Greco-Roman style, which Americans would have seen as tourists in Europe. In 1894 MacMonnies, created a three-quarter life-size female nude statute for architect McKim to put in the garden of the Boston Public library, which McKim designed as a memorial to his deceased wife. The French government was so impressed that it asked to buy it for the Luxembourg Museum, a unique honor for an American. Since MacMonnies had promised it to McKim, he made reductions, one of which is owned by the IMA. In late 1890s Boston consisted of two main classes, those with \"proper\" social status and the immigrants (Irish). The social elite attempted to retain control through organizations such as the Public Library, whose mission was to teach the immigrants the \"socially accepted\" values and morals. This group worked with the religious and Anti-vice groups of the day (Watch and Ward and Women's Christian Temperance Union) to convince the library to refuse the statute. They felt the statute honored vice since she has unruly hair, is smiling and dancing and showing inappropriate influence on an infant by feeding him grapes. Her light-hearted air is not what was acceptable for a proper Victorian woman, and would convince \"others\" to behave in the manner of Bacchante. After a year of debate, McKim withdrew his offer and donated the statute to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, even though the general public approved of the statute. Saint-Gaudens stated that Bacchante had a grace and a life to it that had never been done better. Bacchante shows MacMonnies attention to details, with the life-like expression on her face and the infants, as well as the muscles of the legs as they move up and forward.",
    "Artist Biography": "Sculptor and Painter, born in Brooklyn, died in New York City. Started sculpting with dough at age 3, believed sculptors should paint. Most of his works are Portraitures, in paint or sculpture. Apprenticed to Augustus Saint-Gaudens, studied at Cooper Union and National Academy of Design. Architects Stanford White and Charles McKim loaned him money in 1884 to study in Paris. (supposedly $50) Won three prizes at Paris Salons/exhibitions which lead to MacMonnies opening his own studio and receiving many American commissions. These were often mythical creatures in the Art Nouveau style for fountains, creating a new genre for American sculptures, inspiring a new generation of sculptors. Late 1890s returned to painting, taught drawing with Whistler at Académie Carmen and for two decades was popular teacher at his Giverny estate, which was near Monet's. Among his most famous statutes is the Marne battle Memorial given to France in return for the Statue of Liberty. He was at the head of the American Beaux-Arts movement. MacMonnies was praised as one of first sculptors to acknowledge work of others to achieve end result. Loved reality and concerned with details. Returned to New York in 1915, because wanted Anglo-Saxon models not available in France.",
    "Tour Guidance": "American Spotlight - How French sculptors influenced American sculptors. How art was viewed by various groups in America at the turn of the century.

After image created by the headlights of a passing automobile\".",
    "Artist Biography": "Dove graduated from Cornell University and worked as an illustrator for various magazines in New York. (1903-1907). In 1907, he traveled to Paris and southern France and was influenced by the work of Cezanne and Matisse. On his return to the United States in 1909, he began his association with Alfred Stieglitz. His first abstract work appeared in 1910, similar to Kandinsky's and around the same time. He is credited as being the first innovative abstract painter in America. Two years later, he held his first solo exhibition at Stieglitz's 291 Gallery. In 1913, he exhibited in the Armory Show. Dove developed his abstract works, which he called \"extractions\" by refining and simplifying objects and scenes until color and rhythmic forms took on \"a life of their own\". He believed that objects are not discrete, isolated entities, but active forces whose rhythms are in constant interplay with their environment. The origins in his abstract forms often can be recognized. In 1921, Dove separated from his wife and moved to a houseboat with painter Helen Torr, whom he married in 1924. During this time, he experimented with a variety of materials and found objects which he organized into assemblages, often with great inventiveness and wit. In 1927, he developed a characteristic imagery of irregular, circular shapes swelling outward with haloes of modulated color. (Fog Horns, 1929). This work represents the vital, generative forces of nature. He continued to develop this style on his return to Geneva, New York to settle his family's estate in 1933. In 1938, Dove suffered a heart attack and relocated to Long Island. His later paintings became increasingly more abstract and often restricted to geometric forms. From 1930, he was supported by regular payments from his patron Duncan Phillips. He died in November, 1946 on Long Island.",

    "Gallery Location": "K205",
    "Artwork Description": "The subject of this work is the canal that runs through downtown Indianapolis. The focal points of this canvas are the state capitol and the Civil War monument then under construction. In this painting Gruelle alludes to both Indiana's history and its future. The Canal – Morning Effect is Gruelle's acknowledge masterpiece. With his innate sense of the dramatic, Gruelle alluded to both Indiana's history and its future while painting the reality of contemporary Indianapolis. In 1836 a canal was dug as part of an ill-fated undertaking to connect landlocked Indianapolis with the great Lakes and the Ohio River. The junction was one block from the west side of State House Square; where in 1888 a new state capitol arose, casting its shadow on the waters of this failed project. Working from a vantage point in Military Park, Gruelle also painted the \"monument\" to the left of the capitol. The Indianapolis landmark, erected to commemorate the Civil War, was actually only in the middle of the construction in 1894. Igniting the subtle harmonies of Gruelle's cityscape is the bright red hat worn by the woman crossing the bridge. The small, solitary figure is a perfect foil for the manifestations of civic pride that stand against the rising sun. In this painting by Hoosier Group member Richard Gruelle—his masterpiece—the artist combined observation and invention to depict downtown Indianapolis at the end of the 1800s. Unlike most Hoosier Group scenes, which evoke a general sense of the Indiana landscape, the image in this canvas is an identifiable location. The Indiana capitol building, constructed a few years earlier, rises in the center of the composition and casts its reflection in the waters of the canal. Behind and to the left of the capitol is a monument in the shape of an obelisk that commemorates the Civil War and the victory of the Union over the Confederacy. The obelisk was under construction while this canvas was being painted, so Gruelle used his imagination to complete the structure. The tiny figure of a woman in a red hat crossing the bridge over the canal creates a striking focal point that draws the viewer into this serene morning landscape.",
    "Artist Biography": "Richard Gruelle was born in Kentucky and raised in Illinois. He began drawing as a child. When he was a teenager Gruelle worked as a sign and house painter to gain the knowledge needed to mix and use paints. The budding artist began his career painting portraits. In 1882 he moved to Indianapolis where he painted landscapes in oil and watercolor. Gruelle's efforts were so successful that he was included in an exhibition whose artist's became known as the Hoosier Group. Gruelle traveled to Washington where he saw the Walters collection in Baltimore. He wrote an article on the collection for Modern Art that was read by William T. Walters who commissioned Gruelle to write a catalog of his collection. The intimate study of the Walters collection was the closest Gruelle came to a formal art education. Gruelle maintained a studio in New York and spent his summers at Gloucester on Cape Ann, painting numerous land and seascapes. In 1910 Gruelle and his family moved to Norwalk Connecticut where he died a few years later. His youngest son John (Johnny Gruelle) created Raggedy Ann and Andy. Besides Gruelle, the group included T.C. Steele, J. Ottis Adams, William Forsyth, and Otto Stark. Gruelle, who was largely self-taught, was the only one of the group who did not study abroad. The Hoosier Group was a circle of Indiana painters nationally recognized as among the most important regional artists who painted in the Impressionist style. The Indianapolis Museum of Art has an extensive collection of works by Indiana artists, including the Hoosier Group, who in the late 1800s and early 1900s rendered their state's landscapes in an Impressionist style.",

Rockwell set up a studio in New Rochelle, New York in 1910, close to the Leyendecker brothers and Howard Chandler Christy. Rockwell's connection with The Saturday Evening Post for which he is best remembered began when he was 22 years old. Rockwell did 321 covers for the magazine over the next 47 years. In 1953 the Rockwell family relocated to Stockbridge, MA, now the site of the Rockwell Museum, which is the result of a trust set up by the artist in 1973. In 1963, Rockwell left The Post and began to design covers for Look Magazine and these later images are more concerned with the pressing issues of the time than previous ones had been. Rockwell was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977.",

    "Artwork Description": "Feathered, interwoven brushstrokes in a vibrant palette of rich pastels swathe both figure and landscape, thus unifying the composition. This likeness of Reid's wife, exhibits the artist's impressionist point of view. With a keen sensitivity to the behavior of sunlight, shadow, and colored reflections, Reid used freely brushed strokes to bathe his subject in rich pastel hues. Reid displayed an Impressionist point of view in easel paintings like this portrait of his wife.",
    "Artist Biography": "Robert Reid was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School, the Art Students League in New York and at the Académie Julian in Paris. After three years in France, Reid settled in New York. During the late 1880s Reid followed his Boston classmates Frank Benson and Edmund Tarbell to Paris for study at the Académie Julian. While Benson and Tarbell began exploring Impressionist ideas in France, Reid only fell under the style's influence after returning to the US in 1889. His subjects included landscapes, figures, still-lifes and murals painted in an impressionist manner. Reid was one of the founding members of The Ten American Painters, a group of impressionists who rebelled against academic traditions. He supported himself by painting portraits until he received his first mural commission decorating one of the eight entrance pavilion domes in the Liberal Arts Building for the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago. He later received numerous mural commissions. Best known for murals painted in a decorative style, Reid displayed an Impressionist point of view in easel paintings. He also created stained-glass windows, another indication of his attraction to the effects of sunlight. In the early 1920s, Reid moved to Colorado Springs and taught at Broadmoor Academy during which time he concentrated on portraiture. Reid's distinctive style is best seen in his idealized figures of women which are the hallmark of his easel painting.",

    "Artwork Description": "The recent gift of Morning—Old Schofield's Mill bolsters the IMA's collection of pivotal works by beloved Indiana painter T.C. Steele. The year after completing this 1889 painting, Steele asked an exceptionally high $400 for it in an exhibition and self-published a reproduction in The Steele Portfolio. Although these activities alerted art historians to the work's importance, Morning—Old Schofield's Mill lay hidden in private hands until its donation in 2011. This 1889 painting bridges the artist's moody Munich style and the regional Impressionism that marks his later career. In Morning—Old Schofield's Mill, Steele lightened his palette considerably and used a looser brushstroke and palette knife to apply paint. The new brighter color choice and freed paint application peaked in the later The Bloom of the Grape, considered the first example of Steele's Impressionism. Combining strong technical skill with a more personal painting style, the intermediate period of Morning—Old Schofield's Mill is often considered Steele's strongest. The painting depicts Schofield's Mill, a water-powered grist mill that stood from 1836 until 1967 on Fall Creek, near the present-day site of the Indiana State Fairground. The mill was a landmark along the creek, which marked Indianapolis's north boundary. At the time of its acquisition, Morning—Old Schofield's Mill appeared dark and tonal, typical of Steele's post-Munich landscapes. Treatment undertaken by the IMA conservation department revealed the painting's original atmospheric color, confirming the work as a transitional keystone between Steele's Munich and Impressionist periods. The conservation treatment allows today's viewers to see Morning—Old Schofield's Mill as it was first exhibited in 1890 by the Art Association of Indianapolis, precursor to the IMA, and will ensure a longer life for this important work.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born in Owen County, Steele sought to become a professional artist when few existed in the Midwest and in 1880 traveled to Germany for training at Munich's Royal Academy of Fine Arts. In 1885, Steele returned to Indiana. Pleasant Run, painted just months after Steele's return to Indiana, shows the technical skill and strong modeling mastered in Munich. In 1889 Steele lived and worked near the business center of Indianapolis. When he could not travel to the countryside, he painted rural scenes along the city's outskirts. Steele's eloquent advocacy for Indiana art earned him the title 'Dean of the Hoosier Group.' Around the time he painted Morning—Old Schofield's Mill, Steele wrote his first major art treatise. 'The Development of the Connoisseur in Art' asserted his romantic view that art should reflect 'fine appreciation of the beauty of nature.' Steele devoted the rest of his life to promoting regard for Indiana's culture and native landscape.",

    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "In 1870 Chase moved to St. Louis, where his family had relocated after losing their shoe business in Indianapolis. He hoped to support himself by satisfying the Victorian taste for still-life paintings of flowers and fruit. This early example of Chase's still-life painting suggests his awareness of other American artists. The hummingbird motif probably derives from the work of Martin Johnson Heade, and the bouquet recalls John LaFarge's floral arrangements. Chase considered flowers \"the most difficult\" things to paint, which may account for their scarcity in his work. Yet in 1872 his success in still-life painting induced a group of local patrons to allow Chase to resume this education by sponsoring his attendance at the Royal Academy in Munich.",
    "Artist Biography": "William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then briefly at the National Academy of Design. Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city's Royal Academy. In 1878, Chase returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style. He was a member of America's influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely influential teacher. Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in Shinnecock, Long Island. He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe and Charles Sheeler.",

    "Collection": "American Painting & Sculpture 1800–1945",
    "Date": "1853",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "Also known as the View of Kallenfels the painting is in the naturalistic vein. The story it tells is that of a peasant family wading through a stream to take the path up to their home in the distant mountains. The peasants' path seems to lead into the forest and their village is pictured as being further up the mountain near the peak of Kallenfels (the mountain). I wonder how long it will take them to reach their home. Where did they come from? Where have they been? Whittredge's landscapes are close to nature and carefully composed. Always modest and serene. Summer Pastorale is a \"quiet\" painting. Idealistic. No surprises. There are no billowing storm clouds, nothing to indicate movement. Just a perfect summer day.",
    "Artist Biography": "Whittredge was born in Springfield, Ohio, in 1820. He had little education but a longing to be an artist so he worked at whatever options were provided him. His first venture was to serve an apprenticeship as a sign painter to his brother-in-law. Then, in 1842, Whittredge opened a daguerreotype studio in Indianapolis and when it proved unsuccessful, he closed the business. But before he could leave Indianapolis, he became seriously ill and recuperated for a year in the home of a family friend, Henry Ward Beecher, to regain his strength. His next venture was portrait painting in Charleston, WV, and this too was a bad arrangement that soon ended. He then decided to concentrate on landscapes and was very surprised at his overnight success. His first surviving landscape is Scene near Hawk's Nest (1845, Cincinnati, Ohio) which was painted in the picturesque manner of the Hudson River School artists. He adopted the style of Thomas Doughty originally and then later on, Thomas Cole. His art work usually depicted hills with a lake or stream; distant figures and a far away village. In May, 1849, he left for Europe for further training. There he enjoyed the protection of Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze and attended the Dusseldorf Akademie. Leaving Germany, he joined a circle of friends touring the Harz Mountains and from then on, his paintings followed the naturalistic vein. The summer of 1856 was spent sketching in Switzerland and in September, he and his friends moved to Rome. He remained in Rome for three years painting scenic landscapes as souvenirs for tourists. Whittredge returned to America in 1859. The height of his career came in the mid-1870s when he served two terms as President of the National Academy of Design. Whittredge continued to paint with some regularity to the age of 83, from his home \"Hillcrest\" in Summit, New Jersey. He died at the age of 89.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Primary Tours: Use mountains as the theme of the tour. Ask students to find the distant figures in similar landscapes. Ask students where they think the family is going? Other Tours: Discuss the Hudson River School artists and similarities in landscapes. Discuss why the painting is called Summer Pastorale. Include other paintings on the tour with the same characteristics. The tour could be comprised of all landscapes, with that as the theme.",

    "Artwork Description": "This balanced composition set against a dark background reflects Chase's Munich training. Famous for his rapid technique, Chase claimed he could return at least one fish to market fresh enough to be sold. In 1904, Chase began a series of fish subjects, which was highly acclaimed. This canvas is a spirited example of the genre. There can be little doubt that Chase had seen similar still lifes by the French artist Édouard Manet from the mid-1860s. This broadly painted and carefully balanced composition of shiny fish set against a dark, contrasting background hearkens back to Chase's training in Munich during the 1870s. The painting was one of the artist's favorites. In a letter of 1915 to the IMA (then known as the Art Association of Indianapolis), Chase wrote, \"…I am pleased to know that you care for my fish picture. I feel sure this is the best one I have painted, and I would be much pleased to have it permanently in the Art Association.\"",
    "Artist Biography": "William Merritt Chase was a versatile painter of landscapes, portraits, and still lifes. In fact, he was widely esteemed as the foremost American still-life painter of his era. Born in Nineveh, Indiana, Chase spent a short period as a pupil of Barton Stone Hays, an Indianapolis portrait painter. He continued his studies in New York at the National Academy. Later, he traveled extensively in Europe after studying in Munich. In 1878, he returned to New York, where he made his home. He exerted great influence upon the younger American painters through his teaching. Although his approach was realistic, he invested everything with a particular life and charm.",

    "Artist Biography": "Joseph Delaney, was an American Expressionist painter and a Regionalist whose focus was New York City. He was born in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1904; he died November 21, 1991 in Knoxville, Tennessee. Delaney was the ninth of ten children born to a Methodist minister. He attended church regularly during his childhood and early adolescence. It was during these services that he showed an aptitude for art by drawing on Sunday School religious cards. At the age of thirteen Delaney received a fifty cent prize from his teacher for drawing a sparrow. Two years later, his father died which forced him to drop out of school after the ninth grade to help support his family. He worked as a golf caddie, hotel bellhop and dishwasher. He then began a two year period of riding the rails as a hobo in the Midwest. During those years he sketched various scenes of hobo life and did portraits of his vagabond friends. In 1930, Delaney moved to New York to study at the Art Students League where he remained a member until his death. He became a student of Thomas Hart Benton as did other fellow students, including Bruce Mitchell, Henry Stair and Jackson Pollock. Benton taught him lessons in composition and color. In addition, Benton had Delaney study Botticelli, Raphael and Michelangelo to learn to group figures in the Renaissance tradition. Delaney gave credit to his teacher, George Bridgman, for his ability to capture the human anatomy on canvas, something Delaney does not do in a similar manner. In 1931, Delaney exhibited his work at the first Washington Square Outdoor Art Exhibit. For over forty years that show provided the major outlet for him to exhibit his work. During those years he did drawings of many well-known people who visited the show including Eartha Kitt, Arlene Francis, Eleanor Roosevelt and Tallulah Bankhead. In 1935, Delaney began work with the W.P.A. (Works Progress Administration) Artists Project painting murals at various government sites until the W.P.A. terminated the project in 1943. In 1964, he was a sketch artist for the Ghana Exhibit at the 1964-65 New York World's Fair. In the summer of 1968, he taught for the Art Students League at a workshop sponsored by the Ford Foundation at the Vermont Academy. From 1978-80, Delaney participated in the CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training Act) project as an \"artist in residence\". The CETA project was terminated in 1980 and Delaney, at the age of 76, returned full time to his studio. Delaney returned to Knoxville in 1986, where he became the University of Tennessee-Knoxville's first Artist in Residence, the position he held until his death in 1991.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Primary tours: Use as part of the theme tour \"Voices and Visions: African American Artists at the IMA\". Use as part of the theme tour \"American Spotlight\".

    "Artwork Description": "The artist shows women in a beautiful sunlight garden landscape. The Giverny group of artists became good friends, sharing models and props. The garden shown in the painting was probably the one in the Frieseke yard. Frieseke's wife shared a passion for gardening with Monet. The wives of these artists were friends and often used as models. Miller has used the prop of a Japanese parasol to frame his subjects in the painting. An emphasis has been placed on patterns and bold contrasts in sunlight, often used by the American Impressionists.",
    "Artist Biography": "Miller was a native of St. Louis, Missouri, born in 1875. He worked briefly as an artist reporter for the St. Louis Dispatch. Like many of the Giverny group of Midwest American artists, he studied at the Chicago Art Institute. He later received a scholarship to attend the Academie Julian in Paris and later taught at a rival school—Academie Colarossi. Miller won medals at the Paris Salon and was appointed a Knight of the French Legion of Honor. Miller arrived in Giverny in 1907, to teach the students of Mary Coleman Wheeler during their summer school art sessions. Mary was an artist and educator from Providence Rhode Island. Miller and Frieseke became good friends in Giverny and had the distinction of being known as the leaders of the American group of artists. This included Frieseke, Lawton Parker, Guy Rose, Edmund Greacen, Karl Anderson, William Buehr and Louis Ritman. These men not only painted together but socialized as well. They shared models and drew inspiration from Miller's studio that was filled with collections of fans, parasols, ceramics and other props. Their wives became good friends and they all created a bond a long way from home in America. Frieseke's garden was a favorite spot for afternoon tea, which is probably the scene of this IMA painting. In Miller's view, \"art's mission was not literary, the telling of a story but decorative, the conveying of a pleasant optical sensation.\" He remained in Giverny until late 1914 when the dangers of WWI forced him to return to America. He eventually moved to Pasadena Ca. and taught at the Stickney School of Art, thus playing an important role in influencing the development of Impressionism in Southern California. In 1918 he moved to Provincetown, Mass. becoming a prominent member of the local artist's colony. Miller painted a series of murals in 1923 for the Missouri State Capitol building in Jefferson City, Mo. In his later years he painted marine subjects and he passed away in Florida in 1943.",

    "Micro Summary": "Afternoon Tea captures the genteel lifestyle of the Giverny artist colony, depicting women in Frieseke's garden with Japanese parasols and bold sunlight patterns. As co-leader of the American Giverny group, Miller emphasized decorative beauty over narrative, creating a pleasant optical sensation. The painting exemplifies American Impressionism's focus on light, pattern, and the everyday rituals of the artist community abroad.",

They also traveled to villages in the German countryside to set up their canvases in the open air. Currier helped other American students at the Royal Academy with their landscape painting during their free time. Currier married and lived for many years at Dachau, where he painted some of his best work.",

Brown served as professor of art at Stanford University during the time this work was painted. During his tenure at Stanford University, Brown painted this view of Monterey Bay. While he never travelled abroad, Brown's art certainly came under the influence of French Impressionism, which he probably absorbed from his many artist friends. Chinese Fishing Village makes use of the broken light and color of the Impressionists, yet it remains a painting of subtly modulated hues that achieve a quiet, contemplative mood. In this sense, the landscape is close to those of Brown's contemporaries, Henry Ward Ranger, Chauncey Foster Ryder, and Dwight Tryon, whose interests were in atmosphere and tone rather than the bright colors of the Impressionists.",
    "Artist Biography": "Bolton Coit Brown was the founder of the art department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, and a founder of the Woodstock Art Colony in New York. Brown received his painting degrees from Syracuse University in New York. For more than a decade, he served as Professor of Art at Stanford University in California, where he became chairman of the university's department of drawing and painting. He resigned after being chastised for using nude models in his advanced life-drawing class. Brown took up mountain climbing, making maps and drawings of California's Sierra Nevada Mountains. He climbed and named Mount Ericsson and Mount Stanford. Mount Bolton Brown was named after him in 1922, and Lucy Pass was named after his wife, who was also a mountaineer. Throughout these daring exploits, Brown continued to paint.",

    "Artist (Display)": "Childe Hassam, American, 1859-1935",
    "Collection": "American Painting & Sculpture 1800–1945",
    "Date": "1903",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Gallery Location": "K208",
    "Artwork Description": "Many critics thought that Hassam was most influenced by Claude Monet, but Hassam stressed his debt to John Constable and JMW Turner. However, Hassam's work was always strongly individual. He might have used the bright colors and broken brushwork used in paintings by Monet and Camille Pissaro, but he did not use these methods to dissolve his subjects. He preferred structural clarity and solidness of form that keeps objects intact and space clearly legible. Luminism was American in style, in subject and in attitude. Aspects of the style – concern for light and atmosphere as well as the clarity of form became part of American impressionistic practice. However, some of Hassam's paintings, e.g. Poppies, Isles of Shoals, are better understood not as impressionist paintings, but as related to the reactions to impressionism by such artists as Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. Childe Hassam's paintings of the Isles of Shoals are probably his best works. He met Celia Thaxter around l880 and began visiting the Isles of Shoal in l884. All his images of the isle fall into 2 groups: those between l890 and l894, (when Thaxter died) and those from l899 to l916, when Hassam visited the island often. A number of paintings are mostly outdoor scenes set in Thaxter's flower garden or nearby. One of his best paintings is the Room of Flowers which is cheerful, and gay and painted in the high-keyed palate and the wiry brush stroke for which Hassam is best known. The painting was done in the year that Mrs. Thaxter died. His work was always appreciated and he had no trouble selling his paintings. Hassam had it easy in life. He had the funds and his was not a bohemian life. He was married and he and his wife traveled to Europe and back. He had a facile style, he was prolific and industrious and his art was very popular. He won many awards, but he was not an innovator. However, he created many beautiful and individual paintings. He avoided turmoil in his work so you didn't see the harsher aspects of city life. However, in American Impressionism and Realism, by Barbara Weinberg, Doreen Bolger and David Park Curry, the argument is made that American impressionism and realism are linked: that each was derived from French models, and that nationalism, optimism and nostalgia characterized each. Particularly in Hassam's flag pictures, the nationalism comes through and the paintings become patriotic statements of the U.S. support of WWI and of U.S. technological and military superiority and the triumph of democracy over tyranny. Hassam is quoted as saying that 'I believe the thoroughfares of the great French metropolis are not one whit more interesting than the streets of New York.' The impressionists and the realists, were colored by their desire to preserve the way of life they enjoyed in the past and their fear of what the future might bring. Hassam's paintings of the Old Church at Lyme and the paintings of New England are all efforts to memorialize their lives. And these landscapes are interpretations of optimistic and nationalistic values. The impressionists chose to depict modern life. In doing this, they captured a new vision of the American countryside, city and home. They consciously chose to paint subjects that were intentionally American. Shortly before Hassam died in 1935, he arranged to leave all the paintings in his studio to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. They were to be sold to establish a fund for the purchase of American works to be donated to museums. Cliff Rock is painted in Maine. It was painted in 1903. It is almost pointelistic for one of Hassam's landscapes. It is 24 x 35 inch landscape. It is affected by the Japanese print makers because you seem to see it from above.",
    "Artist Biography": "Childe Hassam was the son of a wealthy merchant and was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1859. He took drawing lessons as a child and teen and tried working as a bookkeeper in 1876. He did not last long and was soon doing woodcuts for a Boston engraver. In 1877-1878, he studied at the Boston Art Club and in 1879, he took a painting class. He opened a studio in Boston and supported himself by doing illustrations for 'Scribner's Magazine' and for 'Harper's New Magazine', and for 'The Century'. He also did landscapes of Boston and its residents. In 1883 he was in Great Britain with a fellow painter, Edmond H. Garrett. He was in Paris from 1886 to 1889 and worked in a studio in Pigalle and by 1887 was producing works that responded to contemporary paintings by the Impressionists. When he returned to the U.S., he settled in New York City, and became close friends and professional colleagues with J. Alden Weir and John H. Twachtman. During the 1890s and the next two decades, he painted during the summers in New England. His favorite spots were Old Lyme Connecticut and Appledore, on the Isles of Shoals, off the New Hampshire Coast. In l897 he helped to organize The Ten American Painters, including himself, Weir and Twachtman. They had all resigned from the Society of American Artists. Also included were Willard Metcalf, Robert Reid Edward F. Simmons and Thomas W. Dewing. Most of the painters were based in New York, but there were three based in Boston; Joseph De Camp, Frank Benson, Edmund G. Tarbell. When Twachtman died in 1902, William Merritt Chase replaced him in The Ten American Painters.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Could talk about colors and Hassam's use of colors e.g., Is rock white? What colors does he use?",
    "Connections": "Hassam could be compared with Monet. He was the most like the French impressionists of the American impressionists. He could be compared with Luminist paintings He could be compared with the Gauguin painting The Flagolet Player. It is the same kind of perspective. The painting could be compared with Georgia O'Keefe's Jimson Weed. Compare with Van Gogh and his use of colors and paints. Compare with The Green Wave by Lacomb",
    "Micro Summary": "\"Cliff Rock—Appledore\" is a 1903 landscape painting by American Impressionist Childe Hassam, created during his productive period visiting the Isles of Shoals in Maine. The 24 x 35 inch work demonstrates Hassam's distinctive approach to Impressionism, employing nearly pointillistic technique while maintaining his characteristic structural clarity and solid forms rather than dissolving subjects like his French contemporaries. The painting shows influence from Japanese printmakers through its elevated viewpoint, reflecting Hassam's ability to synthesize various artistic influences into his own American style. This work exemplifies Hassam's commitment to depicting distinctly American subjects with optimistic and nationalistic undertones, part of his broader effort to create a uniquely American form of Impressionism.\"",

Bearden's parents moved to NYC while he was still a small child and he became acquainted with many of the members of the Harlem Renaissance. Bearden graduated from NYU with a degree in education, having taken extensive courses in art and working on several student publications as a cartoonist and art editor. Bearden was primarily a self-taught artist although he did attend the Art Students League and later, the Sorbonne in Paris on the GI Bill from 1950-54. In Paris he met James Baldwin, Braque and Brancusi. Bearden experimented with various styles, first American Scene and later by the mid 1940s the abstract figurative image as is seen in his depiction of the crucifixion, Golgotha. Bearden was active in the Harlem community, attending the Harlem Artist's Guild, and participating in 306 Group activities. Included in the 306 Group were Norman Lewis, Charles Alston, Ralph Ellison and Jacob Lawrence. The Passion of Christ, a series of watercolor and oil paintings, was exhibited in 1945 at the Koontz Gallery and was later purchased by the Museum of Modern Art, the first of Bearden's works to be purchased by a museum. By the late 40s, Bearden was one of the most respected modernists in America and had exhibited at the Whitney Museum Annuals several times. In 1963, Bearden and Norman Lewis helped to found the Spiral Group whose mission was to define the role of the Black artist within the context of the Civil Rights movement. Bearden's work was influenced by early European artists (such as Durer), as well as other Koontz Gallery artists such as Hans Hofmann, and Robert Motherwell, and by the works of American and European modernists such as Stuart Davies, George Braque, Fernand Leger and Constantin Brancusi. Bearden's art portrays the human image in terms of the African-American experience. Bearden's media included paint, and beginning in 1963-64, collages made from torn paper, tiles, photo enlargements, and patchwork quilts as well as other materials.",

In 1898 Riley delivered a poetry reading to benefit the Art Association of Indianapolis, the forerunner of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. James Whitcomb Riley's portrait was commissioned by the Art Association of Indianapolis and paid for with funds raised at an 1898 benefit performance, in which the poet read his own works. Sargent charged only one-third his normal fee because he often agreed to paint celebrities at minimal cost simply for publicity. Sargent captures the Hoosier poet's personality in this study. While the likeness was received with mixed reviews by Riley's friends, the portrait has an engaging directness befitting the poet's no-nonsense nature",
    "Artist Biography": "Sargent was born and raised in Florence, Italy, by his expatriate American parents. He moved to Paris, where he studied under the famed portraitist Carolus-Duran and attended the École des Beaux Arts, in 1874. Exhibited at the 1879 Salon, Sargent's portrait of Carolus-Duran made an impression on the public and attracted many patrons. Another work, Portrait of Madame X (1884), brought him even more attention due to its audacious display of the sitter's décolletage. The artist's final years were spent in London, but he made periodic visits to America for the purpose of carrying out portrait commissions. Sargent was the most fashionable portraitist in England and the United States because of his brilliant technique, which flattered his subjects.",

Sargent painted the work for only one-third of his usual fee, as he often reduced costs for celebrity subjects in exchange for publicity. The portrait captures Riley's direct, no-nonsense personality, though it received mixed reviews from the poet's friends.",

    "Artist Biography": "American sculptor, Born 1885 St. Paul, MN, Died 1966 New York, NY. Manship grew up in St. Paul, MN attending evening classes at the St. Paul Institute of Art from 1892 to 1903. In 1905 he went to New York where he studied at the Art Students League becoming an assistant to sculptor Solon Borglum. In 1906, Manship moved to Philadelphia where he entered the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. In 1909 he won the Prix de Rome which allowed him to travel to Rome where he studied at the American Academy. There he received technical training and traveled extensively in Italy, Greece and Egypt. He was greatly influenced by the abstract qualities of Etruscan, ancient Greek and Egyptian art. Manship returned to the United States in 1912 and became established in New York. His style was characterized by 'simplified contours' and 'bold asymmetrical design' and bronze was his medium of choice. He received many public commissions, among which is the bronze Prometheus located in the fountain of Rockefeller Center. 'It depicts a sleek, streamlined figure moving through space, and the void is treated with as much importance as the solid.' Manship was associated with the Art Deco movement. Manship always worked in a clean shirt, bow tie and a clean smock. This artist was more interested in line and rhythm ('the spirit which the artist puts into his creation.....') than in meticulous anatomical detail.",

Originally working in the Hudson River School tradition, Blakelock developed a unique style of luminous, introspective, nocturnal scenes bathed in eerie moonlit atmosphere. This work shows his characteristic approach to landscape with emphasis on mood and atmosphere.",
    "Artist Biography": "Ralph Albert Blakelock (1847-1919) was born in New York City and attended the College of the City of New York, intending to become a physician. He began art education at Cooper Union but declined his father's offer for advanced training. Blakelock wandered three years through the American West on horseback, spending time with Native Americans. He was largely self-taught and became known for luminous, introspective nocturnal scenes. Tragically, he lived in poverty, suffered a mental breakdown, and was committed to an institution while his work gained recognition and value.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Blakelock was a great artist but poor businessman who lived with his wife and nine children in poverty. While he languished in a mental institution, his paintings began receiving recognition and prices rose, though none of this benefited his family. His paintings became so valuable they were extensively forged, making Blakelock the most forged artist in America. He's best known as a romantic visionary exhibiting modernist tendencies unique for his time.",

Duncanson produced a series of Scottish landscapes stimulated by his travels and the literature of Sir Walter Scott. Some feel that his best work is reflected in the landscapes of his middle and late periods which define him as a Midwestern romantic realist painter. Moral messages and themes of idealism along with coded messages were sometimes included in his work. In other well-known works, Duncanson used literary subjects in depictions such as Uncle Tom and Little Eva, Lotus Eaters and Pompeii.",
    "Artist Biography": "Duncanson was born in Seneca, New York to an African American (free woman) mother and a well to do Scottish-Canadian father. Early childhood was spent in Canada and later he and his mother moved to a community near Cincinnati, Ohio. Duncanson's rise from a house painter to a recognized landscape painter occurred there around 1842 when he began exhibiting in the area. His progress as a landscape painter caught the attention of Nicholas Longworth, a real estate magnate and prominent Cincinnati Arts Patron. Around 1850 Longworth commissioned Duncanson to decorate the entry halls of his home, 'Belmont', which today is the Taft Museum in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. It was estimated it took about 2 years to complete this ambitious project. The eight trompe-l'oeil framed murals are 9' x 6 1/2', with 3 framed floral bouquets over the doorways, also popular subjects at that time. The murals were recognized as very important and unique paintings created in the United States during the antebellum period of history. Duncanson's landscapes were influenced by the Hudson River School artists who painted romantic images of America's wilderness, untainted by man. With the help of the Freedman's Aid Society of Ohio, Duncanson made several trips to Europe. His position as a free man of color became very much a part of his consciousness and he became associated with the abolitionist leaders in the Cincinnati area. Due to his light complexion, he was sometimes confused as being a white artist. However, he was able to overcome the ordeals of racial discrimination and emerged as the first African American to rise to prominence in the International Euro-American art community. He was known for his travels and besides Cincinnati; he lived in Detroit, Michigan, and painted countless landscape scenes in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New England, Canada and Scotland. Towards the end of his life Duncanson suffered a tragic dementia with delusions and outbursts. At the time they believed he suffered from arsenic lead poisoning that accumulated from his exposure to house paints and artist's pigments. By 1870 his psychotic behavior became public knowledge. During the installation of one of his exhibitions he suffered a seizure and collapsed. He was hospitalized and two years later passed away on December 12, 1872. A national touring retrospective exhibition of his work, \"Lifting the Veil\", was assembled in America to show more than 50 of his paintings after his death. This impressive exhibit gave him added recognition and respect as a talented African American artist.",

These works are cityscapes which show skyscrapers and factories but usually do not include people. These works have the illusion of loneliness and isolation. The lights are on but there are no people present.",
    "Artist Biography": "American precisionist painter, born October 17, 1886, New York City; died October 8, 1944, Lexington, KY. Fisk decided by his late teens to become an artist. Starting in 1904, he took classes at the Art Students' League, later taking classes at the National Academy of Design and spending two years studying with Robert Henri at his studio at 1947 Broadway. Here, students were exposed to a very modernist point of view and here also Fisk probably met Stuart Davis, who became a lifelong friend. In 1912, Fisk traveled to Paris to study at the Academie Moderne under Fauvist painters Othon Friesz and Pierre Laprade. While in Paris, Fisk became close to Charles Demuth, who was also at the Academie, and Marsden Hartley. Also in Paris were: Stuart Davis, Elie Nadelman, Edward Steichen, Alfred Maurer, among others. Many of these artists frequented the salons hosted by Gertrude and Leo Stein. Returning to New York in 1913, Fisk remained strongly influenced by Modernist artists. He regularly visited Alfred Stieglitz's gallery known as \"291\". Though living with his family, Fisk spent much time in Greenwich Village, moving in circles of artists, writers and others. This cultural \"avant-garde\" spent summers in Provincetown, Massachusetts which Fisk did as well. Fisk was represented by the Daniels Gallery, which also represented Demuth. His work began to be included in exhibitions that included works by other Modernists such as Hartley, Davies, O'Keeffe, Man Ray, and, in 1922, an exhibition that included Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Burchfield, Pousette-Dart and others. Among other friends was Eugene O'Neill whose sister-in-law Fisk married in the early 1920's. Though his career was progressing well, by the mid-1920's Fisk was tired of city life and in September 1926 he left his wife and moved to Lexington Kentucky, accepting a teaching position at the University of Kentucky. He remained there for the rest of his life, teaching drawing and painting classes, forming new friendships, and eventually remarrying. He began to work in printmaking, later having exhibitions of his work in Lexington and New York.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Compare this piece to other cityscapes nearby including Storrs' New York. Compare to Hopper's Hotel Lobby which also has the feel of isolation. How does each artist convey that feeling? Compare to other highly geometrical works, for example Lewitt's Wall Drawing. This painting is basically about light. What are the light sources and how does the artist use them?",

    "Collection": "American Painting & Sculpture 1800–1945",
    "Date": "1885",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "This painting shares in the tradition of narrative purpose and humor prevalent during the first half of the 19th century in America, but Beard's humor is more cutting. This satirical tone may have been a response to an America no longer innocent in the wake of the Civil War and the social strife that accompanied it. Animals in Beard's paintings represented humans, as evident in this painting showing animals clothed in human attire and standing on two feet. Beard poked fun at the new American who was no longer a \"rustic\" but who seemed instead to be secure and superior in his economic, intellectual, and cultural identity. Narrative elements were important to Beard's paintings, and he sometimes illustrated well-known stories, but he transformed them for his satirical purpose rather than merely illustrating them. This painting presents animals in a realistically rendered setting, but there are obvious clues, such as human posture and clothing and the dramatic black drape hanging from the trees behind \"His Majesty,\" the fox, to suggest the artist has in mind another purpose for the scene beyond a typical forest gathering of animals. Consider a number of narrative elements in the painting that together might suggest meaning: the natural relationship between the various animals portrayed and the fox, the royal garb of the fox, the humble poses of the rabbits and other animals, the mysterious black drape, the look on the fox's face, the looks on the faces of the other animals, perhaps even the season of the year, and the double meaning of the word \"receives\" in the title. Consider a number of artistic elements in the painting that together support possible interpretations of the work: the touches of red, the black drape, the drab browns and grays of the setting and the other animals' attire, the movement created by the composition for emphasis on the drama represented.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born in 1824 in Painesville, Ohio. His family could trace its American roots to the early 17th century, but Beard was \"raised in modest circumstances\" because of his father's death shortly after Beard was born. His only art lessons came from his older brother, James Henry Beard (1812-1893), with whom William painted in New York during the 1840s. Best known for allegorical animal and landscape paintings. These types of works were \"both critically acclaimed and a source of public controversy.\" Beard's works pointed out flaws in human behavior in the guise of animals. Bears, squirrels, rabbits, cats, and monkeys were his best known subjects. He painted and exhibited in Ohio; Buffalo, NY; Europe and New York City over the course of his career. Beard was instrumental in helping to develop an artistic community in Buffalo, New York. These efforts culminated in the establishment of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy in 1862. Beard moved to New York City in 1860 and rented a studio in the renowned Tenth Street Studio Building, where he came into contact with other artists, including Albert Bierstadt (a lifelong friend he had met in Europe), Frederic Edwin Church, William Merritt Chase, and Winslow Homer, all of whom are represented in the IMA collection. During his years in New York City, Beard was involved in plans for a museum to be built on Manhattan Square, land owned by Central Park. The museum was intended by Beard's patron, Henry Keep, to be a \"vehicle for social improvement, free and open to all.\" Beard designed the museum to portray \"the gradual progress of the world from barbarism to civilization.\" The plan was ultimately abandoned because of Keep's death. Some of Beard's most famous works included those that poked fun at the ruthlessness of Wall Street and Darwin's theory of evolution.",

    "Micro Summary": "William Holbrook Beard's \"His Majesty Receives\" is a satirical 19th-century American painting that uses anthropomorphized animals to critique post-Civil War American society. The work depicts a fox dressed in royal attire receiving humble rabbits and other forest creatures, with the fox representing the newly prosperous American who has abandoned rustic simplicity for cultural superiority. Beard employs narrative elements like the animals' natural predator-prey relationships, human postures and clothing, and a dramatic black drape to create layers of meaning beyond a simple forest scene. The painting's composition uses touches of red against drab browns and grays to emphasize the dramatic tension and social commentary. This reflects Beard's response to America's loss of innocence following the Civil War and accompanying social upheaval.",

    "Artist First Name": "James Abbott McNeill",

    "Collection": "American Painting & Sculpture 1800–1945",
    "Date": "1881",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "This is a composition of color harmonies, rather than an accurate likeness. Therefore, the work fits into the Tonalism area of the American gallery. Lord Meux commissioned Whistler to paint three full-length portraits of his wife. The three portraits were commissioned by Lord Meux for 1500 guineas, although Whistler later agreed to accept 1200 guineas for the three portraits. Whistler painted two nearly identical versions of this portrait; the second is at the Frick Collection in New York. Lady Meux was a colorful, attractive figure who reputedly rode an elephant to an English hunt. The fact that she was a supremely fashionable lady undoubtedly appealed to Whistler. Even though the modern subject and modern techniques were used, a critic thought Whistler painted in the tradition of the old masters. This work is painted on very coarse canvas. Her face is painted quite thickly, but so thoroughly worked that it has a fine matte surface. It has a sultry glow which is set off by the thinner paint of her glossy bodice. Whistler painted with \"bold, broad crisscross strokes on the ruffles, and short, racy touches on her hat.\" The hat originally extended further right. The floor beneath Lady Meux is indefinite; a horizontal line of paint seems to cross under the foot of her train, as if a carpet or stairs were originally drawn there. Whistler eliminated his original floor line or step that he had painted beneath her feet. When Lady Meux sent her maid as a substitute sitter while she went to Egypt on vacation, Whistler positioned the hat further forward than it is in the finished work. His butterfly signature was originally much lower than it appears on the finished picture; the original location of the butterfly can be seen clearly in an early photograph.",
    "Artist Biography": "American painter, printmaker, designer and collector, active in England and France. He developed from the Realism of Courbet and Manet to become, in the 1860s, one of the leading members of the Aesthetic Movement, and an important exponent of Japonisme. From the 1860s he increasingly adopted non-specific and often musical titles for his work, which emphasized his interest in the manipulation of color and mood for their own sake rather than for the convention depiction of subjects. He acted as an important link between the avent-garde artistic worlds of Europe, Britain and the U.S. and has always been acknowledged as one of the masters of etching. From his monogram \"JW\", Whistler evolved a butterfly signature, which he used after 1869.",
    "Tour Guidance": "All ages of visitors find the beautiful, very sensuous, young woman attractive. Since the canvas Whistler used was very rough, he worked on the face of Lady Meux at great length. His results were outstanding. He was recognized as an outstanding artist including as an expert in engraving. Very young visitors, for example, are attracted to the pastel colors, i.e., pink shades. Some young visitors might think how they would like to dress for a high school picture, say for a high school prom, as they view her full-length portrait. Adult visitors tend to want to see any works of the renown Whistler, whose portrait of his mother (Whistler: Arrangement in Gray and Black No. 1) is well known. The docent might wish to compare Lady Meux's portrait by Whistler to Dorothy's portrait by her father, William Merritt Chase. Both are full length where pastel colors prevail. Dorothy Chase is portrayed in her youth; that compares well with many of our visitors.",

    "Micro Summary": "Harmony in Pink and Gray: Lady Meux is a Tonalist composition prioritizing color harmonies over accurate likeness, one of three commissioned portraits of the fashionable and colorful Lady Meux. Whistler worked extensively on her face creating a sultry matte surface contrasting with her glossy bodice, using bold crisscross strokes and his signature butterfly mark. The painting exemplifies Whistler's role as a key link between European and American avant-garde art movements and his mastery of the Aesthetic Movement.",

Marin's work focused on three major themes: the city (New York), the sea (Maine), and the southwest (Taos). Alfred Stieglitz exhibited and sold his work and introduced him to O'Keeffe, Hartley, and Dove among others. Marin's work was exhibited in the Armory Show of 1913. Marin was an American artist, exploring American themes and working to establish a uniquely American style of painting.",
    "Artist Biography": "American painter and printmaker, born 1870 Rutherford, NJ, died 1953 Cape Split, ME. Marin attended Stevens Institute in Hoboken NJ, working briefly as an architect before studying at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1899 to 1901. Marin traveled for five years in Europe, where he learned first hand about avant-garde trends. After returning permanently to the US in 1911, Marin settled in New York where he began his long career of depicting the city and the country. His initial works showed the influence of Impressionism and PostImpressionism. During the next decade, his art moved toward a more modernist style, with Fauvist handling and color and an abstract sense of design. In the 1920's, Marin's style became more expressive and abbreviated with objects ever-more simplified. His city images underwent a major transformation in the 1930s as the figures increased in scale and became more important elements in the scenes.... The natural landscape was also important to Marin, who had a very real love of nature. He traveled often to Hew Jersey, upstate New York, New England, New Mexico, and Canada. Probably his best-known images are those of the sea along the coast of Maine which he created in the 1930's. Marin worked extensively in watercolor, only beginning to devote more of his attention to oils in the 1930s. Marin received critical praise during his lifetime, which was unusual for the early American modernists. He became a member of the artistic circle centered around Alfred Steiglitz who exhibited his works at his galleries beginning in 1909.",

    "Micro Summary": "John Marin's \"Hurricane\" reflects the artist's deep connection to Maine, which he discovered in 1914 and visited annually each summer. The work exemplifies Marin's belief that art must be connected to the outside world rather than existing solely in the mind. As part of his focus on three major themes—the city, the sea, and the southwest—this piece captures the raw power of Maine's coastal environment. Marin was dedicated to exploring distinctly American subjects and developing a uniquely American style of painting.",

The shadowy valley, rugged woodcutters, and twisted trees exhibit striking contrasts of light and dark, rough textures, and intricate forms.

In another allusion to the picturesque, Shaw fashioned two of the rocky features in the distant valley to resemble the ruins of European castles.",

Shaw immigrated to Philadelphia in 1817 to oversee the installation of Benjamin West's painting Christ Healing the Sick at the Pennsylvania Hospital. In 1819, he traveled with his teenage son to the South to create watercolor scenes of the area that were engraved in acquaint and published as a book, Picturesque Views of American Scenery (1820-1821). After returning to Philadelphia, Shaw created over two hundred oil paintings.",

    "Artwork Description": "Example of Luminism. Luminism was a uniquely American style of painting that abandoned the romantic conventions that dominated landscape painting. Luminists were interested in rendering the light that illuminated the landscapes more so than the landscape itself. Typical luminist principles include a low horizon that dominates the painting; water as a main pictorial element; sharp, bright light that creates a hard edge; invisible brush strokes; and a panoramic view. Painted in a studio from outdoor sketches. Grand Manan, New Brunswick, Canada is a real place, but this is not a real scene. Pantheism – seeing God in nature. Optical illusion – when you travel from one side of the painting to the other, the ray of light coming from the sun travels with you.",
    "Artist Biography": "American Landscape Painter, Born 1837, Died 1908. Bricher was largely self-taught, and as an artist was known in his lifetime as a successful landscape painter in the style of the Hudson River School. Bricher was from Portsmouth, N.H. and began painting in Boston around 1851. He moved to New York City in 1870, and even though most of his time was spent there, most of all Bricher's subject matter was drawn from summer sketching trips to Massachusetts and Maine coasts, and Rhode Island. Bricher's maritime scenes are all coastal scenes, usually panoramic with a broad horizon line. With an emphasis on bright, sharp light, they carry the viewer out to a clear, crisp horizon. While boats are often in his pictures, figures are rare. Luminist principles are evident in Bricher's works and he is considered one of the last of the Luminist artists. As such, he was predominately interested in the pictorial effects of light and translucency. It is always possible to ascertain the time of day, weather conditions and geography in his work. Bricher and his comtemporaries, Fredrick Kensett, Fitz Hugh Lane, Martin Johnson Heade, Fredrick Church, and Sanford Robinson Gifford, formed this group of artists that were painting in this uniquely American style. Bricher's painting career lasted for more than 50 years.",

    "Micro Summary": "Alfred Thompson Bricher's \"Morning at Grand Manan\" exemplifies American Luminism, a style that prioritized capturing light over landscape details. The painting features typical Luminist elements including a low horizon, water as the central focus, sharp bright light with hard edges, and invisible brushstrokes creating a panoramic view. Though depicting the real location of Grand Manan, New Brunswick, Bricher composed this idealized scene in his studio from outdoor sketches. The work embodies pantheistic beliefs by presenting God through nature, and includes an optical illusion where the sun's ray appears to follow the viewer across the composition.",

Lawrence was a storyteller and captured the social changes of the great migration as African-Americans moved to industrialized urban centers in the North. Many of his paintings were done as a series - ex. Great Migration Series, Harlem Series, John Brown Series, Frederick Douglas Series, and Harriet Tubman Series, which required a great deal of historical research. He used flat, geometric shapes in silhouette form, abstract, not posed, like a snapshot. The picture shows the crowded tenement housing which was part of his life.

    "Artist Biography": "Born 1917 in Atlantic City, New Jersey - Died 2000 in Seattle, Washington. His mother was from Virginia and his father was from South Carolina before they migrated north in search of what they thought was \"The Promised Land\". They found this was not the case as jobs were going to white employees. They had three children of which Jacob was the oldest. Later they moved to Philadelphia, again in search of work. After Jacob's father left, his mother moved to Harlem looking for employment. She left her children in Philadelphia for three years until she was financially able to bring them to Harlem. In Harlem his favorite pastime was exploring the bustling city streets, each window or doorway he passed told a different story - men hunched over pool tables, mothers preparing dinners, or mourners gathered in a funeral parlor. Jacob was also exposed to a number of famous musicians like Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, and \"Bojangles\" Robinson. All this was a rich background for his later work. He was trained in New York at the height of the Harlem Renaissance. Mrs. Lawrence, a hardworking single mother, enrolled Jacob in WPA-sponsored, after-school art classes at Utopia House, where the painter Charles Alston was teaching. By 1935, the nineteen-year-old Lawrence began to study at Alston's Harlem Workshop and the American Artists School. There he studied with Anton Refregier, Sol Wilson, Philip Reisman, and Eugene Morely. Sculptor Augusta Savage, who had just returned from Paris, took an interest in Lawrence's work and arranged for his employment at the Federal Arts Project. For the first time, the government actively supported the arts through President Franklin Roosevelt's Federal Arts Project (FAP), part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Black artists were given the opportunity to practice their art full-time. Jacob Lawrence brought the history of black life to the canvas. He managed to render rich and brilliant color from the limited medium of flat tempera, and to transform formless designs into living, moving shapes. Often accompanied by text, his paintings are epic, sweeping narratives of the everyday experiences of forgotten and ordinary life. His paintings memorialize the tragedy, the aspirations, the perseverance, and the joy of everyday African Americans. The paintings of Jacob Lawrence tell stories. Stories of enslavement and freedom, of human migration and renaissance and of struggle and triumph. No artist before Jacob had developed themes from African-American history. He used historical themes from the Civil War period to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's. In 1990 he received the National Medal of Arts Award. In 1994, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He is admired for being the first black visual artist to make African-American historical traditions the subject matter of his art.",

    "Artwork Description": "Typical Benton scene of rural America depicting an ordinary person doing a simple daily task. The flat, rather simplified style of the horse and the man in the painting are typical of Benton's style. There are several common objects in the foreground that exemplify the workaday world of rural life. The undulating shapes of the ground and sky are characteristic of Benton's works and suggest the vitality of nature with relentless, energetic rhythms. The colors are very muted and seem to be typical of colors in nature on an overcast day. This painting actually depicts a farm on Martha's Vineyard, not Missouri as originally thought. Benton and his wife Rita spent 50 summers on Martha's Vineyard between 1920 and 1975, and it was there that Benton developed his Regionalist style. The subject, Henry Look, was an acquaintance of Benton's who posed for him a number of times. According to the 1940 Census, Look was a 64-year-old white male farmer with an 8th grade education who owned his home in Chilmark, MA on Martha's Vineyard. Look delivered milk to Benton until Benton saw the man straining milk through a used handkerchief. The hilly terrain depicted is characteristic of Martha's Vineyard's glacial landscape, with Chilmark having dramatic bumps with boulders. Look's wife, Eva, was part of a large deaf community on Martha's Vineyard.",
    "Artist Biography": "American painter, illustrator, lithographer. Born April 15, 1889, Neosho, Missouri. Died January 19, 1975, Kansas City, Missouri. Studied art in Washington DC (as the son of a congressman), the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Académie Julian in Paris (until 1909). Thereafter, he studied independently. In Paris he was exposed to modernist styles; focused on Impressionism and Pointillism; was influenced by Diego Rivera and a number of American artists such as John Marin and Stanton Macdonald-Wright. Returned to the US in 1912, first to Missouri and then to New York where he remained until 1935. During his early years in NYC, he painted pure abstract works. Became interested in Marxism. Joined the Navy in 1918. Became interested in drawing ordinary people and rejected modernist abstract styles. Produced his first major paintings in the 1920s, including his first large historical works such as American Historical Epic (Kansas City, MO, Nelson-Atkins Museum). He married and had two children during this time. Began teaching at the Art Students League (NYC) by 1926 and became aware of socially concerned Mexican muralists such as Diego Rivera. By 1930, he won mural commissions, including the Arts of Life in America at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1932). Was the teacher of artist Jackson Pollock between 1931 and 1935 at the Art Students League. In 1933 painted the Social History of the State of Indiana for Indiana's pavilion at the Chicago World's Fair (now in Bloomington, Indiana; Indiana University Auditorium). Painted in the realistic Regionalism style of art, along with Grant Wood and John Steuart Curry. Left NYC in 1935 to paint the anti-capitalist mural on the Social History of the State of Missouri in the State Capital at Jefferson City (completed in 1936). Late 1930s, taught at the Kansas City Art Institute; also created numerous lithographs and book illustrations, including those for John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. Continued to paint after WWII and was widely exhibited and collected in the heartland of America but was disdained by the New York art world.",

    "Artwork Description": "Upon the death of her husband in 1901, Mrs. Benjamin Harrison commissioned Tiffany to create a window in his memory. The window, the lower half of which appears here, was installed in 1905 at the First Presbyterian Church, 16th and Delaware Streets, Indianapolis, where the president had served as an elder for more than 40 years. Absorbed in scores of projects, Tiffany probably left the window's conception to his team of talented designers, contributing his own thought before giving final approval. The design shows Michael, the Angel of the Resurrection, signaling the dead to rise at Christ's second coming. In keeping with the romanticism of the time, Tiffany's heroic angel is dressed in the chain mail suit of a crusading knight and seems like a figure from Sir Walter Scott's novels. The deep blue inner ring behind the angel has five separate layers, creating a dark background that increases the window's drama. Angel of the Resurrection, the lower half of which appears here, was commissioned by Mary Lord Harrison, second wife and widow of President Benjamin Harrison, upon her husband's death in 1901. It was installed at the First Presbyterian Church in Indianapolis, where the president had served as an elder for more than forty years. Perhaps because he carries a trumpet, the figure is often mistaken for Gabriel, Angel of the Annunciation, but it is actually Michael, Angel of the Resurrection, who signals the dead to rise. Tiffany, who was absorbed in scores of projects, likely left the window's conception to his team of designers, contributing ideas before giving final approval. His assembly of windows was innovative-the lead does not just hold the glass, it defines the contours of the images and creates decorative patterns. Tiffany also perfected the plating technique, in which glass sheets are sandwiched on top of each other, producing mesmerizing effects of color and depth. The blue ring behind the angel, for example, consists of five layers, creating a dark background that increases the drama of the image. Window inscription: Awake thou that sleepest. Arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light. -From Ephesians 5:14",
    "Artist Biography": "The dominant figure in American decorative arts for more than half a century, Louis Comfort Tiffany founded several firms to satisfy the strong demand for his art glass, metalwork, pottery and furniture. Tiffany's enthusiasm for sensuous materials and striking colors found full expression in his stained-glass windows. From 1877 through the 1920s, he and his craftsmen produced thousands of windows for churches, institutions and homes across the United States. Tiffany manufactured all the glass for his windows, and the Tiffany Furnaces at one time had over 5,000 different colors and varieties in stock. Mottled glass, a hallmark of Tiffany's creations, appears throughout the Harrison window. Its swirling opalescent and iridescent finishes are the result of adding chemicals to the cooling molten glass. Drapery glass, used to superb effect in Michael's robes, was a Tiffany invention achieved by manipulating hot, viscous sheets of glass until the desired cloth-like folds appeared. Another textural variation occurs in the angel's wings, where the Tiffany craftsmen ruffled the glass surface in imitation of feathers. Also innovative was Tiffany's assembly of the windows. The leading does not just hold the glass in place; it defines the contours of the windows' images and creates decorative linear patterns. Tiffany also perfected the plating technique, in which glass sheets are sandwiched on top of each other, producing extraordinary effects of color and depth. Typical of Tiffany's efficiency, he used the enormous amount of scrap glass from his window production to make the vibrantly colored lampshades for which he may be best known.",

    "Artwork Description": "The IMA owns two other landscapes by Whittredge, Summer Pastorale, produced in Germany and Lake Shawangunk, painted along the Hudson River. This third landscape was created late in Whittredge's career and maintains the theme of small figures within a larger landscape begun in Whittredge's German paintings and continued in his Hudson River scenes. Here, instead of figures crossing a body of water on foot or boat, they travel down a path surrounded by large trees and a cloud-filled blue sky in a style. The scene reflects the artist's ongoing engagement with one of the more idealistic missions of the Hudson River School--an attempt to understand humandkind's place within the vast landscape designed by their creator.",
    "Artist Biography": "Worthington Whittredge, as he called himself after 1855, was born on a farm in Springfield, Ohio. He moved to Cincinnati in 1837, worked with his brother-in-law as a house painter, and taught himself to paint portraits and landscapes. He experimented with daguerreotypes in Indianapolis, opened a portrait studio in Charlestown, West Virginia, and then returned to Cincinnati. From 1843 on, he devoted himself to landscapes. Through the efforts of wealthy Cincinnati art patron Nicholas Longworth, Whittredge was able to study for five years in Düsseldorf, Germany. He also spent five years in Rome before returning to the United States in 1859. Whittredge settled in New York City, where he opened a studio. He experienced some difficulty adapting his European skills to the American scene. The quality of light seemed different to Whittredge, who was accustomed to the frequently overcast skies of central Germany. His search for an American style was aided by the example of Sanford Gifford, whom he had known in Düsseldorf and Rome.",

    "Micro Summary": "This landscape painting by Worthington Whittredge was created late in his career and features small human figures traveling down a tree-lined path beneath a dramatic, cloud-filled sky. The work continues Whittredge's characteristic theme of depicting tiny figures within expansive natural settings, a motif he developed during his time in Germany and refined in his Hudson River paintings. The composition reflects the Hudson River School's idealistic mission to explore humanity's relationship with the divine through nature's grandeur.",

    "Artwork Description": "The painting's complex color harmonies and crusty interwoven strokes infused with soft light exhibit the elements that make Twachtman a key American Impressionist. This peaceful scene was painted on the artist's farm in Connecticut. The complex color harmonies and thick, interwoven strokes of pigment in A Summer Day recall the French painter Claude Monet's canvases. Twachtman was inspired by the chromatic experiments of the Impressionists. Rhythmic lines in the contour of hill and rock, the bent figure in the boat, and the curve of the water's edge form a decorative pattern, which is repetitive, yet varied. This peaceful scene of a figure on a small lake was painted on the artist's farm in Connecticut.",
    "Artist Biography": "John Twachtman was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1853. His career began at age fourteen, when he helped his father decorate window shades. He studied in Munich with William Merritt Chase and Frank Duveneck. Twachtman's early paintings were in the Munich manner. In 1883, he attended the Académie Julian in Paris, where he came under the influence of French Impressionism. His paintings shifted from the dark, shadowy Munich palette to soft gray and green tones. He became one of the founding members of The Ten, a group that included America's most important Impressionist painters. Twachtman lightened his palette to the point where white dominated his canvases. He favored pure landscape, often excluding figures and buildings. When they did appear in his scenes, they were obscured by the hazy atmosphere. Twachtman's landscapes took on an abstract quality that anticipated the modernist style.",

    "Artist Biography": "American painter of portraits, interiors, dancers, musicians, still lifes, and flowers. Born 18 December 1862, New York, New York; died 1953, Long Island, New York.

In 1883, Bell enrolled in the Royal Academy in Munich as a student of Ludwig von Loefftz a realist painter who stressed the Dutch and Spanish masters. Bell exhibited in many important exhibitions while in Munich, but he earned international attention with a piece shown at the Paris Exposition of 1889. \"The Lady in Gray\" was a very non-traditional work which incorporated a softly-patterned scrim as a background. Returning to the US in the 1889, Bell continued to achieve recognition with his delicately hued paintings of women in intimate interiors. Bell often used Japanese decorative objects in his small portraits as did both Whistler and Chase. During his lifetime, Bell exhibited and won prizes at the Royal Academy. He also exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York, the 1893 World's Colombian Exposition and the Pan-American Exposition in 1901. He was a member of the Art Student's League and an Associate Member of the National Academy of Design.",

This lady, concentrating on adjusting her hat with a pearl-tipped hatpin, is typical of Edmund Tarbell's refined, everyday subjects. The passages of loose, energetic brushwork in her blouse and hair display the spontaneity that Tarbell brought to his outdoor Impressionist paintings. Artists of the Boston School explored aspects of texture, which can be seen in the handling of the creases in the woman's blouse and the feathers on her hat. Tarbell's expert drawing technique is evident in the rendering of the sitter's arm and the handling of her facial features. In fact, a corner of one of Vermeer's paintings appears at the upper right of Tarbell's elegant interior as a tribute to this Dutch master.",

These painters were renowned for their pictures of young women engaged in sedentary and often solitary domestic activities, or posed in sunlit outdoor settings. In his interior compositions, Tarbell concentrated upon the insular world of upper-class women, depicting them in an austere but elegant manner, attired in the latest fashions. Like many painters of the Boston School, Tarbell was influenced by the paintings of the 17th-century Dutch artist Jan Vermeer, whose works were rediscovered in the mid-19th century.",

    "Artwork Description": "The portrait of Marie Jane Andrew, age, 7, was commissioned in memory of the girl soon after she died. She is dressed in an elaborate early Victorian costume and seated among the objects of her childhood; a sewing box, school books, treasured sea shells, and a Staffordshire pottery figure of a dog. In addition to offering a wealth of information about the decorative arts of the period, this portrait is an excellent example of a self-trained professional portrait artist working in the nineteenth century. Mason had difficulty rendering such simple objects as a book, a table top, and a chair in proper perspective. The little girl's extremities, too, are less than convincing. The artist's sense of composition and design makes up for any shortcomings in technique. The piping on the child's dress creates an interesting play of lines with the gold chain about her neck; the window encasements direct the viewer's eye to her head, the focal point of the picture. The portrait is an interesting example of a picture within a picture. The painting of a boy in the upper left is believed to be the girl's brother, James, who had also died very young. The distant landscape, seen from the window, is probably their familyl home.",
    "Artist Biography": "Joseph Mason was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and attended John James Audubon's classes in drawing in Cincinnati. He traveled with Audubon on a flatboat to New Orleans and drew at least fifty flowers for Audubon's bird paintings.

He died of pneumonia at age thirty-four.",

    "Collection": "American Painting & Sculpture 1800–1945",
    "Date": "1865",
    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "The oil painting depicts a poignant moment as a man and woman separate—the Union soldier to go to battle and the woman to stay home. The bond between them appears to be one of romantic love, reinforced by the statue of Venus de Milo painted in the background (Venus is the Roman goddess of love). Given the date in the title, 1861, the theme of separation makes sense. However, since the painting was actually completed in 1865, the final year of the Civil War, Lambdin could have been conveying a dual meaning: both the separation of a couple as a soldier goes to war and their reunion (and the re-Union of the North and South) when the soldier returns successfully. Further support for this interpretation can be found in the color of the woman's dress, gray, the uniform color of Confederate soldiers. The painting's title projects a powerful and solemn message. Consecration means the act of setting apart as holy, making or declaring something sacred for religious use. Numerous elements in the painting serve to reinforce this theme: the manner in which the light falls onto the woman and specifically illuminates her face as she kisses the sword; the darkness of the canvas except for the lighted portion where the woman's lips meet the sword; the angle and manner in which the heads of the man and woman are bowed in a reverent way. The sword is a stylized Union Army Model 1860 Staff and Field Officer Sword. Lambdin's paintings of the Civil War address human and psychological aspects of the war, rather than portray a specific military event. The Civil War officers painted by Lambdin resemble his younger brother, James Harrison (Harry) Lambdin, who was also an artist and served in the Civil War. Notice the vase of roses behind the officer and the rose the officer is holding up to his cheek. Lambdin frequently used flowers in the background of his early paintings before he turned in his later works to flowers as his central subjects.",
    "Artist Biography": "American painter, born January 6, 1830, Pittsburgh, PA; died January 28, 1896, Germantown PA. Lambdin began his art studies with his father, James Read Lambdin (1807-1889), a portrait and landscape painter who founded a museum in Pittsburgh in 1828 and directed the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia from 1845 to 1864. The younger Lambdin first exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1848 and at the National Academy of Design, NY, in 1856. In the mid-1850s he traveled in Europe; however, he spent most of his professional career in Philadelphia. He was elected an Academician by the Pennsylvania Academy in 1863 and by the National Academy of Design in 1868. During the late 1860s, Lambdin was at the Tenth Street Studio Building, NY, which was an important center of artistic activity. Lambdin's early works were primarily genre paintings, sentimental scenes of childhood, bereavement and Civil War subjects. The Consecration, 1861 was shown at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867, together with The Last Sleep (also known as The Dead Wife) which received critical acclaim. In general, Lambdin's paintings were well-reviewed when exhibited and were collected at the time by leading patrons of the arts. After a short trip abroad in 1870, Lambdin returned to his home in Germantown, PA, and turned to painting primarily floral studies, especially roses from his own garden. His emphasis on floral still-life painting was practical as well, since there was a growing popular demand for such paintings. Many of Lambdin's flower paintings were reproduced as chromolithographs by Louis Prang & Co., of Boston, MA, and were widely distributed. Lambdin remained an active member in both artistic and horticultural circles until his death in 1896.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Discuss the use of light and dark areas in the painting for purposes of emphasis and mood. Use as part of an American Art Spotlight Tour. Use as part of tours on Patriotism in America (highlighting portrayals of historical events, leadership, independence and military engagement). Use for The American Experience (highlighting in broader terms some of the historical, cultural, geographical, religious and military influences and events in the development of the United States). Use for American History as Art Interprets It (highlighting the interpretation of history with the emphasis more on the art than on the historical events).",
    "Connections": "Our Flag, 1864, by Frederic Edwin Church; American Gallery. This is a painting of a 31-star flag on a rocky cliff, above the smoke of battle. This is also a Civil War-era piece, and the number of stars on the flag indicates the artist's optimism on behalf of the Union's eventual triumph. A Break: Playing Cards, 1881, by Julian Scott; American Gallery. Though painted after the Civil War ended, this portrays a scene from that era. Unlike Lambdin's painting that can be interpreted as emphasizing separation, Scott's scene shows its subjects coming together for a more light-hearted moment in the midst of war. The Boat Builders, 1873, by Winslow Homer; American Gallery. Homer and Lambdin were both in New York painting in the late 1860s, and it is believed that Homer may have had some influence on Lambdin's work.",

    "Micro Summary": "George Cochran Lambdin (1830-1896) was an American painter who trained under his father at the Pennsylvania Academy and worked at New York's prestigious Tenth Street Studio Building, initially creating sentimental genre scenes before turning to highly successful floral still-lifes that were widely reproduced as chromolithographs. \"The Consecration, 1861\" (1865) is a dramatically lit Civil War painting depicting a solemn moment as a woman in gray (possibly symbolizing the South) kisses a Union officer's sword while a statue of Venus suggests romantic love, with the work's dual date suggesting both wartime separation and the possibility of reunion as the war ended. Exhibited at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle, the painting exemplifies Lambdin's focus on the psychological and human aspects of the Civil War rather than specific military events, possibly featuring his own brother Harry who served as a Union soldier.",

During stretching exercises, clients of the salon \"unfurled\" like the flowers in O'Keeffe's painting on the wall behind them. Arden paid O'Keeffe $10,000, considered an astonishing amount at the time, for the largest floral composition the artist would ever create. The four blossoms are placed in an energetic design that repeats the tight rhythm of the jimson weed's pinwheel-shaped flower. About this plant, which grew near the artist's home in New Mexico, O'Keeffe said, \"When I think of the delicate fragrance of the flowers, I almost feel the coolness and sweetness of the evening.\" She emphasized her subject's fresh beauty with a bright, simplified palette and rhythmic treatment of light and shadow. O'Keeffe, one of the first American modernists, was at the heart of the group of artists who gathered around Alfred Stieglitz, the photographer and art dealer who became her husband. The sheer size of her flowersan arresting manipulation of scale-represented a radical modernist innovation.

    "Artist Biography": "Georgian O'Keeffe was born the second of seven children. She spent the first 14 years of her life on the family dairy farm in Wisconsin. She decided early in life t become an artist. From 1905 to 1906, she attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1907, she went to New York to study at the Art Students League. In 1908 she saw the first American exhibit of the work of Matisse and Rodin at 291 Gallery run by Alfred Stieglitz, who was the noted photographer and advocate of indigenous American art. During the summer of 1912 she attended a drawing class taught by Alon Bement at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. Through Bement she becomes interested in the anti-academic system of art education developed by Arthur Dow. For the next six years she incorporated this system in here teaching at schools and colleges in Virginia, South Carolina, and Texas. In 1915, she produced a series of large charcoal abstractions. Stieglitz saw the series in 1916 and exhibited them at his 291 Gallery. O'Keeffe moved to New York in 1918 with a promise from Stieglitz of financial support. They married in 1924 and subsequently lived and worked in New York and at Stieglitz's Lake George estate. In 1929, O'Keeffe spent her first of many summers painting in New Mexico. After Stieglitz's death in 1946, she traveled extensively internationally painting scenes from airplanes. In 1949, O'Keefe moved permanently to Abiquia, New Mexico. She continued to work in oils until her eyes failed in the mid-1970. In her old age, she learned to be a hand-held potter. In 1973 she met Juan Hamilton, a ceramic artist. He became her assistant and constant companion until her death in 1986, in Santa Fe. During her lifetime, she received many honors and awards including the American Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Art. She is considered on of the first American Modernist. O'Keefe's paintings were inspired by the look of things in her world: Flowers, animal bones, landscapes, the in Texas and New Mexico, or the scenes of Lake George, New York, and Manhattan.",

Attention is drawn to the sitter's face through the use of light and the white shirt collar. Morse is best known as the inventor of the telegraph, but he was also an established artist. Morse's portrait of Dr. Finley is characteristic of his best canvases. Sensitively observed and firmly painted, it reveals a careful delineation of features without affectation, and with a subordination of minor details. Dr. James E. B. Finley (1758-1819) was an uncle of the artist, and it was Morse's hope to make a reputation for himself in Charleston because of his uncle's position there. Edward Lind Morse tells of Morse's arrival in Charleston in 1818 and reveals the following about the portrait: \"At first, however, the promised success did not materialize, and it was not until after many weeks of waiting that the tide turned. But it did turn … around the enthusiasm of the Charlestonians, and others began to pour in, so that in a few weeks he was engaged to paint one hundred and fifty portraits at sixty dollars each.\"",
    "Artist Biography": "Samuel Morse, best known for his invention of the telegraph, was born in Charlestown Massachusetts and graduated from Yale College in 1810. With the American painter Washington Allston, he visited England and studied with Allston and Benjamin West in London. Returning to the States five years later, Morse established himself in New England as a portrait painter. In 1820 he became the first president of the National Academy of Design. Between his New England and New York sojourns Morse was in Charlestown, South Carolina. During the years he received many commissions to paint portraits and, at the same time, he worked experimentally in chemistry and electrical and galvanic fields. As is generally known, Morse conceived the idea of the telegraph while on broad the packet ship Sully on his way from Europe to America in 1832.",

    "Artwork Description": "Henry Inman was the brother-in-law of Clara Fisher's sister Caroline. Clara Fisher debuted in London in 1817 at age six, and in the following ten years toured throughout Great Britain in numerous child and adult roles. Her family came to the United States in 1827, and she debuted in New York City that year. Clara Fisher was a sensation and performed in theaters in nearly every major city over the next seven years. During the \"Clara Fisher Craze,\" her name was given to babies, stagecoaches, brands of cigars, hotels, steamboats, and racehorses; and she was generally considered to be the leading actress of the American stage. Clara Fisher was married in 1834 to James G. Maeder, a composer and vocal coach. They opened a theater in New Orleans, had seven children, and Clara continued to perform with the great actors of the time. Her popularity declined in later years but she continued to act until 1888 (she was 77 years old). She finished an autobiography in 1897, and died the following year at age 87. According to her autobiography, this portrait was done in 1828, the same year as a very similar portrait was done by a Baltimore portrait painter. Clara Fisher would have been about 17 years old at the time. Her autobiography says that she is wearing a medal which was given to her January 1, 1828, at the Park Theater in New York City. She also mentions the bracelet on her upper arm, saying she was very fond of it. \"It was solid gold with a rather large medallion portrait of George Frederick Cooke, of whom my father was a great admirer.\" Clara's father was a librarian and well-known English amateur actor, and Cooke was an English actor (1756-1812). She further states that a Mr. Edmund Simpson owned the original miniature portrait, and loaned it to Thomas Barry to have it copied for the medallion of the bracelet.",
    "Artist Biography": "American painter. Born 28 October 1801, Whitestown (near Utica), New York; died 17 January 1846, New York City. Inman moved to New York City with his family in 1812, and two years later (at age 12 or 13) obtained an apprenticeship with John Wesley Jarvis, the city's leading portrait painter. He worked with Jarvis closely, more as a collaborator than as an apprentice. In 1823, he set up his own practice, and was instrumental in founding the National Academy of Design in 1825. As vice president of that organization and as part of the growing cultural community in New York, Inman began to receive portrait commissions from prominent families and government officials. He also painted literary, historical, and genre subjects, many of which were engraved for illustration in journals and gift books, which brought him further renown. Inman moved to Philadelphia in 1831 and became partners with the engraver Cephas G. Childs in a lithographic firm, as well as continuing to paint portraits. After three years there, he returned to New York and was at the height of his career from 1834-1839. Like Philadelphia's Thomas Sully, Inman in New York was called \"the American Lawrence,\" in reference to the English portrait painter, Thomas Lawrence. Inman's portrait subjects included such notable figures as Supreme Court Chief Justices John Marshall and Samuel Nelson, John James Audubon, and Martin Van Buren. Inman also painted a series of North American Indian portraits. He was hired by Thomas L. McKenney to copy earlier portraits by Charles Bird King for a History of the Indian Tribes of North America, which would be illustrated with hand-colored prints based on the painted portraits. Inman continued to paint despite financial difficulties and deteriorating health. He traveled to England in 1844, which briefly revived his health and spirits. He returned to New York in 1845, and died January 17, 1846 (at the age of 44), shortly after an exhibition was held to raise money for his impoverished family. Inman painted in a romantic style with softened contours and a restrained brush, and he often gave his sitters a genial expression or glint of humor. In his portraits of women and children, he conveyed sweetness without sentimentality.",
    "Tour Guidance": "In a tour focused on portraits, point out how personal items in the painting give clues or information about the life of the sitter. As part of a tour of paintings which have other art in them, point out the portrait miniature in Clara Fisher's bracelet medallion. Use the portrait to encourage visitors to look more closely and think about the painting: Who do you think this young lady is? What do you think is around her neck? What do you observe about the other jewelry she is wearing? Can you make up a story about her?",
    "Connections": "Compare to other portraits that include clothing or personal items which help identify the person, such as George Washington at Princeton, also in the American galleries. Compare to other paintings of young women of a similar age in the American galleries: Preparing for the Matinee by Edmund Charles Tarbell, and Girl Sweeping by William M. Paxton. What might you infer from the paintings about the life and social class of the different young women?

    "Micro Summary": "Henry Inman (1801-1846) was a prominent American portrait painter who apprenticed under John Wesley Jarvis and became a founding member of the National Academy of Design, earning recognition as \"the American Lawrence\" for his romantic yet restrained portraits of notable figures including Supreme Court justices and John James Audubon. This 1828 portrait captures Clara Fisher, a celebrated teenage actress who had caused a sensation in America after her debut the previous year, at the height of the \"Clara Fisher Craze\" when her name adorned everything from cigars to steamboats. The painting exemplifies Inman's skill at conveying character through personal details, showing the 17-year-old actress wearing a commemorative medal from the Park Theater and a gold bracelet containing a miniature portrait of English actor George Frederick Cooke, revealing both her professional achievements and family connections to the theatrical world.",

In Tonalist paintings a single hue dominates the composition, which evokes the nuances of light and atmosphere. The softened details and unpeopled terrain exhibit Tonalism's quiet, meditative state.

He became identified with Tonalism, an American style influenced by the Barbizon painters and Whistler's landscapes. In Tonalist paintings a single hue – often blue or gray – dominates the composition and related colors create a subtle chromatic range that evokes the nuances of light and atmosphere. The softened details and windswept terrain of The Harbor Light exhibit Tonalism's quiet, meditative state.",

He turned to painting in 1876 and studied first at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then spent six years in Paris, where he enrolled at the École des Beaux Arts. He returned to New York and taught landscape painting at the Art Students League. Harrison concentrated almost exclusively on landscapes executed in the evocative manner of the Barbizon artists. He was a prolific writer on art, and in 1909, Harrison published Landscape Painting, which became the standard text for many years. In addition, he founded the art colony in Woodstock, New York.",

    "Artwork Description": "Jacob Cox was trained as a tinsmith, a trade that he followed for a time even after he began painting in the early 1840s. Cox received many portrait commissions but found more personal enjoyment in painting landscapes. The carefully depicted pet and the image of leisure activity combine to create an engaging impression of the boy's personality and interests. Cox's portrait of Charles H. Brewer hung in his son Charles's home for fifty-five years before it was offered as a gift to the IMA. The family recounts that the elder Brewer was about twelve years old when Cox painted him. According to Brewer's son, the artist finished the painting in his studio, added the fishing rod and dog, which did not belong to the sitter. Such attributes, including the imaginary landscape in the background, were common practices in nineteenth century portraiture and served to enhance the sitter's status or, in this case, add to the image of a childhood.",
    "Artist Biography": "Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in separate ferry accidents. Cox's grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians. By that time the young Cox was already interested in art. He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in Indianapolis. The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time. By 1835 painting portraits was added to Cox's business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith, Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National Academy of Design. Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire. When the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers. He continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.",

Though Cox preferred landscape painting, he received many portrait commissions and enhanced this work by adding fictional elements including a fishing rod, dog, and imaginary background landscape in his studio. These added attributes were common in 19th-century portraiture to convey the subject's interests and enhance their social status. The portrait remained in the Brewer family for fifty-five years before being donated to the IMA, creating an engaging impression of the boy's personality through carefully chosen symbolic elements.",

    "Artist Biography": "Debt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life. Born in North Kingston, Rhode Island, and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter, who took him to Scotland. His mentor's death forced Stuart to return to America. During the Revolutionary War, Stuart traveled to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West. As success came, so did debt, which forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland, and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas without using any preliminary drawing. Stuart was prolific – he painted over one thousand portraits of important political figures. One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the \"Athenaeum Head,\" which is currently on the dollar bill.",

    "Artist Biography": "Hopper was brought up in Nyack, NY on the Hudson River where he developed a love for the nautical life. In 1900 he enrolled in a commercial illustration class at the New York School of Art and after a year he started classes in painting and drawing with William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri. In the autumn of 1906 Hopper traveled to Paris to study European artists often working \"en plein\" air. He first exhibited in 1908 at a group show in NYC organized by some of Henri's students. Hopper continued to work as an illustrator (even winning a top prize for a poster Smash the Hun). He moved to Greenwich Village in 1913, which remained his permanent base. He exhibited at the Amory Show in 1913 with Sailing, the first painting he sold; he did not sell another for 10 years. In 1920 he held his first one-man show at the Whitney Studio Club. By 1923 Hopper re-established contact with Josephine Nivison whom he had known at art school. She encouraged him to take up watercolor. They married in 1924 and painted together in New England. When they returned to NYC, he had his second very successful exhibition at the Frank KM Rehn Gallery where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1925, Hopper painted House by the Railroad, which became the first painting by an artist to be acquired for MOMA. In 1933 Alfred Barr organized Hopper's first retrospective for MOMA. Hopper and his wife continued to spend their summers painting in Cape Cod where they built a home in 1934. A feeling of loneliness and detachment pervaded his works in the second half of his career. A 1950 retrospective at the Whitney was regarded as the work of an enduring realist. By 1964 when the Whitney hosted this third retrospective, he was hailed as the forefather of the new avant-garde.",

    "Artwork Description": "Historical Reference: On Tuesday evening, March 1, 1932, 20-month-old Charles Lindbergh, Jr., son of aviator Charles Lindbergh, was kidnapped from his crib. Two and one half years later, on September 19, 1934, a suspect, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, was arrested. A journalist at the time called the trial of Hauptmann, \"the greatest story since the Resurrection.\" While that is an exaggeration, the public interest does make the Hauptmann trial stand with the O.J. Simpson and Scopes trials as among the most famous trials of the 20th century. Hauptmann was electrocuted. The painting is a fascinating work not only because of the American social history it documents, but also because of the basic truth expressed in its cast of characters. A middle-aged woman, dressed for cold weather while waiting in the gloom of New York's Penn Station, is absorbed in a newspaper trumpeting a Depression-era event, which riveted the nation's attention: Bruno Hauptmann has been convicted of the kidnapping and murder of aviator Charles Lindbergh's son; he must pay with his life. With an honesty that is almost painful, as well as characteristic, Marsh captures the essential isolation of individual human beings who must mark time in impersonal caverns such as Penn Station. Eight people are discernible in the picture, and each is an island unto himself. The painting is rare among Marsh works in that it depicts an interior scene. Marsh is more noted for his New York City street scenes, bustling compositions that capture the gritty flavor of jockeying for position on the crowded sidewalk or, at times, those brief moments when individuals are transfixed in the privacy of their own thoughts while a seemingly insensitive city flows about them.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born Paris, March 14, 1898; died Dorset, VT, July 30, 1954. American painter, printmaker and illustrator. He returned from France to the USA with his American parents, Fred Dana Marsh (1872–1961) and Alice (née Randall) Marsh, who were also artists, in 1900. In 1920 he graduated from Yale University, New Haven, CT, where he had been art editor and cartoonist for the Yale Record. He moved to New York and became staff artist for Vanity Fair and the New York Daily News. By 1923 he had begun painting scenes of street life in New York in oil and watercolor. His first one-man show was held at the Whitney Studio Club in 1924. In 1925 he joined the New Yorker, to which he contributed regularly until 1931. In 1925 Marsh traveled with his first wife, sculptor Betty Burroughs, to Europe where he studied and copied the works of the Old Master painters such as Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt and Michelangelo, whom he particularly admired for their ability to organize large figure groups. In 1927–8 he studied at the Art Students League in New York under Kenneth Hayes Miller, who encouraged him to paint the earthy vitality and social landscape of life in New York, subjects typical of American Scene Painting. Marsh painted and made prints of scenes such as Dance Marathon and Times Square, the 'El' or elevated railway, and the Bowery, often taking preparatory photographs for the painting. In 1929 Marsh was shown by Thomas Hart Benton how to use egg tempera, the medium in which most of his street scenes of the 1930s are painted. In the 1940s he experimented with the 'Maroger medium', an oil emulsion formula promoted by Jacques Maroger of the Musée du Louvre, Paris, who believed it to have been used by some Old Master painters. In the last two decades of his life Marsh continued to depict the same themes, for example The Bowery—Strokey's Bar.",
    "Tour Guidance": "American gallery tour has several paintings by artists that Marsh studied with or was influenced by their work. For example: John Sloan (Red Kimono on the Roof), Thomas Hart Benton (Henry Look Unhitching). The Hats theme tour. There are at least five hats worth pointing out on a Hats tour. VTS. The painting is crowded with people, five of whom are facing the viewer and have a story to tell from the expressions on their faces. In the same gallery, you can look at Guy Pene Du Bois' Promenade. He painted at the same time as Marsh and was also a social realist. He would often paint a witty and mocking view of New York society. He developed a style dominated by simplified and stylized figures.",
    "Connections": "Compare Henry Look Unhitching with other IMA artworks of the same time period: Edward Hopper's Hotel Lobby (1943); Reginald Marsh's Hauptmann Must Die (1941); Isabel Bishop's Tidying Up (1941); Joseph Delaney's The Artist's Party (1941-1943).",

Marsh's social realist masterpiece documents American history while revealing the painful isolation of individuals in impersonal urban spaces. The rare interior scene showcases Marsh's characteristic honesty in depicting New York life and human psychology.",

    "Medium": "oil on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "This canvas is perhaps the only panoramic underwater scene in 19th-century American art, and it is the aquatic equivalent of a Hudson River School landscape.Moran may have been inspired by underwater exploration related to the laying of the first successful telegraph cable in 1858. The Valley in the Sea is the first and perhaps only panoramic underwater view in nineteenth-century American art. It is most likely that Dr. James M. Sommerville, the original owner of Valley in the Sea, commissioned Edward Moran to create this painting, which was executed in Philadelphia. In 1859, Sommerville published Ocean Life, which included illustrations of seventy-five different species of aquatic life. In 1860, Matthew Fontaine Maury published The Physical Geography of the Sea and Its Meteorology, the first textbook on modern oceanography. There is a marked similarity between some of Maury's descriptions and Moran's paintings. A 1971 letter from Jacques Cousteau stated, \"Ed Moran's painting … is a work of imagination, based on serious documentation.\"",
    "Artist Biography": "Born in England, Edward Moran immigrated to Maryland in 1844, where his father was a hand loom weaver. One of twelve children, Moran left home to work in a cotton factory in Philadelphia, where he also drew large sketches. He and his brother Thomas studied and shared a studio in Philadelphia before returning to England to continue their artistic training. Edward Moran is best known for his marine paintings. His style was influenced by J. M. W. Turner's seascapes and seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Dutch painting. Although his brother Thomas Moran is the more famous of the two artists, Edward Moran was unequalled during his time as a marine painter.",

Her poised bearing attains the grace and harmony of the neo-classical and its Greco-Roman prototypes, but imbues Ruth with sweetness and charm, as noted by her poignant gesture and beseeching gaze.\n\nComposition subtly leads the viewer around an ever-changing circuit of angles and curves, light and shadows. Its detailed sheaves of wheat, plants, and costume show Rogers' interest in naturalistic and anecdotal accuracy.",

He apprenticed under Lorenzo Barteloni, the leading talent of Tuscan sculpture, a neo-classicist.\n\nHe modeled in clay & plaster, selected the marble and the carving was then done by studio assistants under his direction.\n\nFor 20 years he worked in the heart of the English community in Florence and in 1853 modeled one of his most successful statues, Ruth Gleaning, earning him the reputation as a skillful interpreter of biblical and literary themes.\n\nReceived his first public commission, creating a statue of John Adams for Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.\n\nHis most prestigious work was the bronze doors for the entrance to Rotunda of US Capitol, depicting in 8 low-relief panels scenes from the life of Columbus using as inspiration Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise for the Baptistry in Florence, Italy.\n\nHe married, fathering 9 children, suffered a paralytic stroke in 1892, and died in 1892, being buried beside his wife in Rome, Italy.",

Rogers, who studied in Florence and Rome and maintained a highly successful studio producing works for patrons across America and Europe, shows Ruth in classical dress with idealized features characteristic of Neoclassical sculpture, her downward gaze and humble posture emphasizing her devotion and virtue. The work exemplifies mid-nineteenth-century American sculptors' preference for biblical and historical subjects rendered in white marble with smooth, refined surfaces, demonstrating Rogers's technical mastery and his ability to convey moral narratives through graceful figural composition that appealed to Victorian sensibilities.",

The play of light on the painting gives it a soft touch. He also gives a human interest touch to the painting by adding the lady. The figure is essential to the composition which combines genre and landscape.",
    "Artist Biography": "American painter and teacher. Born July 8, 1851, Amity, Indiana; died January 28, 1927 Indianapolis, Indiana. John Ottis Adams was one of the major figures in Indiana art. A contemporary of T.C. Steele, Adams studied art at the South Kensington School in London under John Parker from 1872-1874. He lived in Muncie, Indiana from 1876-1880 painting portraits. In 1880 he traveled with T.C. Steele, Samuel Richards and others to Munich, Germany. He made many copies of old Masters while abroad and also painted both scenes including figures and landscapes outdoors. Upon his return to Muncie, Indiana in 1887 he was a key member of the \"Hoosier Group\" consisting of T.C. Steele, Otto Stark, William Forsyth, and Richard B. Gruelle, engaging in both portrait painting and teaching, at the same time carrying on his landscape work. In the same year he opened an art school with Mr. Forsyth in Muncie. In 1888 he established an art school in Fort Wayne, Indiana and also was active in the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis. He was the principal instructor at the school from 1904 to 1909. He shared a house with Steele, which contained separate studios, in the town of Brookville in Franklin County, Indiana called \"The Hermitage\". The picturesque countryside around Brookville was a favorite painting ground for artists. It has been called the \"The Indiana Barbizon\". His Academic Munich work falls into three fairly equal categories. The first consists of Hoosier school pieces; second are the Academic German genre scenes of peasants in interiors; the third features scenes of peasants working in the fields. His early pictures were portraits but Adams excelled in landscapes to which he devoted his activities in the later years. He specialized in painting the rural landscapes of Indiana. Adams's paintings also include scenes from Michigan lakes where he often spent his summers and scenes from Florida, where he spent his winters.",

When he returned in 1909, he became a faculty member of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, teaching painting and drawing for the next forty-one years. Garber was known as one of the leaders of the Pennsylvania Impressionists, or the New Hope School, as the group was called. He depicted the quarries, woods, and Delaware River Valley of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. His home near Lumberville was not far from the great stone quarries at Byram, New Jersey, which he often painted. Like most Impressionists, Garber painted out of doors directly from nature. These patterned scenes were dominated by shades of blue, green, and yellow. His work earned gold medals and numerous awards and prizes.",

    "Artwork Description": "The intricate network of trellis, railing and awning are woven into an ordered composition. Strokes of brilliant color are applied with a sensitivity to light and shade acquired from regular outdoor painting. Sharman's current obscurity is hard to understand considering this beautiful scene. Another article in the Boston Transcript praised At the End of the Porch as \"a beautiful, luminous and joyous picture of a place where one would like to be. It represents a glassed-in porch, in the summer, and a lady sitting at her work; through the windows may be seen masses of shrubbery and white blossoms. An admirable canvas, it has the quality of reserve, but that does not prevent it from conveying with singular aptitude a most artistic impression of a lovely scene.\" In At the End of the Porch, Sharman used the intricate network of trellis, railing, and awning to define space and construct a well-ordered composition. Upon his framework, he has lavished broad strokes of brilliant color, applied with sensitivity to light and shade that Sharman acquired from regular painting out-of-doors (en plein air). The summer sun burns the striped awning with salmon-tinted hues, casts deep shadows on the silent porch, and bleaches vines into a wave of white blossoms.",
    "Artist Biography": "John Sharman's biography reads like the ideal formula for establishing the American artist of repute: training under Frank Benson and Edmund Tarbell at Boston's Museum School, a steady exhibition schedule, and favorable reviews of his mature work. A 1922 article discussing an exhibition of Sharman's paintings states, \"Not in a long time has such a stimulating one-man show been seen in Boston as the present exhibition of John Sharman.\" Despite the numerous articles of praise written about Sharman, not a word about this artist or his work appears in texts on American painting, even those that specialize in artists with an impressionistic style. The IMA library's vertical files contain a folder on Sharman that includes many of the articles written about him during his lifetime.

    "Artist Biography": "Diego Rivera was a talented Mexican painter associated with the muralist movement. A communist, he was often criticized for creating paintings that were too controversial. Along with José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siquieros, he is considered one of the \"big three,\" most important Mexican muralists. Today he is remembered as much for his volatile marriage to fellow artist Frida Kahlo as he is for his art. Early Years: Diego María de la Concepción Juan Nepomuceno Estanislao de la Rivera y Barrientos Acosta y Rodríguez was born in 1886 in Guanajuato, Mexico. A naturally gifted artist, he began his formal art training at a young age, but it wasn't until he went to Europe in 1907 that his talent truly began to blossom. 1907-1921 Rivera's Years in Europe: During his stay in Europe, Rivera was exposed to cutting-edge avant garde art. In Paris, he had a front row seat to the development of the cubist movement and in 1914 he met Pablo Picasso, who expressed admiration for the young Mexican's work. Leaving Paris when the First World War broke out, he went to Spain, where he helped introduce Cubism in Madrid. He would travel around Europe until 1921, visiting many regions including southern France and Italy, and would be influenced by the works of Cezanne and Renoir. Return to Mexico and Beginnings of the Muralist Movement: Returning to Mexico, Rivera soon found work for the new revolutionary government. Secretary of Public Education José Vasconcelos believed in education through public art, and commissioned several murals on government buildings from Rivera as well as fellow painters David Alfaro Siquieros and José Clemente Orozco. The beauty and artistic depth of the paintings gained Rivera and his fellow muralists international acclaim. International Work: Rivera's fame earned him commissions to paint in other countries besides Mexico. He traveled to the Soviet Union in 1927 as part of a delegation of Mexican communists. He painted murals at the California School of Fine Arts, The American Stock Exchange Luncheon Club, and the Detroit Institute of the Arts, and another was commissioned for the Rockefeller Center in New York. However, it was never completed due to controversy over Rivera's inclusion of the image of Vladimir Lenin in the work. Although his stay in the United States was short, he is considered a major influence on American art. Return to Mexico: Rivera returned to Mexico, where he resumed the life of a politically active artist. He was instrumental in the defection of Leon Trotsky from the Soviet Union to Mexico: Trotsky even lived with Rivera and Frida Kahlo for a time. He continued to court controversy: one of his murals, at the Hotel del Prado, contained the phrase \"God does not exist\" and was hidden from view for years. Another, this one at the Palace of Fine Arts, was removed because it included images of Stalin and Mao Tse-tung. Marriage to Frida Kahlo: Diego met Frida Kahlo a promising art student, in 1928; they married the year after. The mixture of the fiery Kahlo and the dramatic Rivera would prove to be a volatile one: they each had numerous extramarital affairs and fought often. Rivera even had a fling with Frida's sister Cristina. Diego and Frida divorced in 1940 but remarried later the same year. Rivera's Final Years: Although their relationship had been stormy, Rivera was devastated by the death of Frida Kahlo in 1954. He never really recovered, falling ill not long after. Although weak, he continued to paint and even remarried. He died of heart failure in 1957. Legacy: Rivera is considered the greatest of the Mexican muralists, an art form which was imitated around the world. His influence is greatly important in the United States: his paintings in the 1930's directly influenced Franklin Roosevelt's work programs, and hundreds of American artists began creating public art with a conscience. His smaller works are very valuable and many are on display in museums",
    "Tour Guidance": "Possible Questions to start the discussion: 1. What affect does cropping have on this scene? (Creates the image that there are many sleeping people above and beside the woman and child. Creates the image that the woman is physically supporting many others besides the child). 2. Does this scene resemble a picture of Madonna and Child, how? 3. Do you get a sense of comfort or discomfort, why? 4. What social economic class do the woman and child belong to? What makes you think this? Background information for docents to use age appropriately and sparingly, particularly if the visitors ask questions or indicate they want more information:",

    "Micro Summary": "\"Sleep\" is a work by renowned Mexican muralist Diego Rivera (1886-1957), measuring 16 1/4 x 12 inches for the image and 20 1/2 x 15 1/8 inches for the full sheet. This intimate-scale piece represents a departure from Rivera's famous large-scale public murals that depicted Mexican history and social themes. The artwork captures a quiet, contemplative moment focused on the universal human experience of rest and repose. As with much of Rivera's work, it likely demonstrates his masterful draftsmanship and ability to imbue everyday subjects with deeper meaning and emotional resonance.",

    "Artwork Description": "With loose, fluid brushstrokes, the artist depicts the boats, cottages, and shore of this harbor, while still emphasizing the flat surface of the canvas. Paintings of Provincetown fishermen executed in a more somber palette so dominate the artist's work that this lively, vibrant painting of Hyannisport, a town 50 miles away, represents an intriguing contrast. Hawthorne is so strongly associated with Provincetown that it is something of a surprise to find that he took a painting trip to Hyannisport, about fifty miles away. What is even more unusual is that the works painted in Hyannisport are much closer to Impressionism than his normally realist Provincetown technique with its somber palette. This loose, fluid sketch has the spontaneity of a painting rendered out of doors, directly before the subject. With unhesitating strokes of the brush, Hawthorne transcribed the boats, cottages, and shore of this Cape Cod harbor. He abandoned his usual somber palette in favor of the bright blue hues common to Impressionist seascapes. His summary treatment of the figure and boats, and his subtle distinctions between sky, shore, and sea, emphasize the flat surface of the canvas. This sketch of Hyannisport's harbor is an eloquent expression of the artist's love of the Massachusetts coast.",
    "Artist Biography": "Hawthorne studied under William Merritt Chase and helped run Chase's Long Island school before founding the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The town attracted many artists, and Hawthorne became known as the \"father\" of the art colony. A student of William Merritt Chase and a lover of the Old Masters, Hawthorne is equally known as a teacher and artist. His skill at depicting the fishermen in Provincetown is legendary, while his work in Hyannisport is much less known.",

Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city's Royal Academy. In 1878, Chase returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style. He was a member of America's influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely influential teacher. Chase opened one of the first summer schools of landscape painting at his summer home in Shinnecock, Long Island. He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley, Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe and Charles Sheeler.",

    "Artwork Description": "Painted in 1902, this is one of a number of portraits of family members painted by Chase. This is one of a series of female full-length portraits painted by Chase between 1886 and 1902. Chase frequently painted his wife, Alice Gerson Chase (22 times), and their eight children. Dorothy Bremond Chase was painted at least 15 times at various ages and settings. In 1902, Chase created four full-length portraits (The Open Japanese Book, Dorothy, Mrs. Chase in Pink and Master Robert)–the scale of which indicates that they were likely exhibition pieces to attract potential clients. Chase was particularly proud of these portraits and regarded them as among his best work. Wearing a charming straw hat and a fashionable, pleated white dress rendered in confident, broad brushstrokes, Dorothy confronts the viewer with her direct, unwavering gaze and self-assured demeanor. Dorothy received numerous positive reviews. One historian praised the artist's depiction: \"When Mr. Chase combines portraiture and genre painting as in Alice and Dorothy...he makes pictures that are simply bewitching. Dorothy has more of the challenge of the young miss who feels her power, but wants you to know that she feels it.\" Dorothy was purchased from the artist at the Exhibition of Indiana Art in Tomlinson Hall in Indianapolis in 1903 using the John Herron fund. Chase painted just over 600 known portraits--his most active period being the last ten years before he died, completing one every two weeks on average. Chase founded the Shinnecock Summer School of Art in 1891 and taught classes there in the summer. After 1902, he took his summer students on trips to study art in Europe.",
    "Artist Biography": "American painter of Impressionist landscapes, realistic still lives and memorable portraits of family members was born in Williamsburg (now Nineveh), Indiana in 1849, and died in New York City in 1916. Chase studied for five years in Munich returning to New York City in 1878. Chase was an avid teacher during his career having taught at the Art Students League, the Brooklyn Art Association, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and at the New York City School of Art and the Shinnecock Summer School of Art both of which he founded. Chase was a founding member of the Society of American Artists, which challenged the authority of the National Academy of Design. Chase's large, elaborately decorated studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building was the most famous artists' studio in America as well as a gathering place for New York artists. Dressed in a flowing cape and accompanied by his Russian wolfhounds, Chase presented himself as an aristocratic bohemian. Chase's prodigious output of nearly 2000 works was influenced by Tonalism, Impressionism and Realism. Among the artists taught by Chase were: Charles Demuth, Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and Edward Hopper.",

    "Artwork Description": "Alaska was probably done in the artist's studio from sketches made during his ill-fated voyage on board the Ancon. The artist's subject is the vast scale of the fog-shrouded mountains and wilderness. The group of Indian hunters and the dark forest add to the scene's mystery and must have suggested to nineteenth century viewers a place on the edge of their imagination. The canvas expresses Bierstadt's sense of wonder before the vast untamed wilderness.",
    "Artist Biography": "Born in Düsseldorf, Germany, Albert Bierstadt came to New Bedford, Massachusetts, with his family when he was a baby. He returned to Düsseldorf in 1853 to study at the Royal Academy. He traveled throughout Europe with fellow students Sanford Gifford and Worthington Whittredge. Bierstadt returned to America in 1857. One year later, he began painting the Rocky Mountains, which was a subject he would return to often. He made numerous trips to the West, painting and exhibiting in California. In 1865, he built a home on the Hudson River near New York City, but his fame lies in his landscapes of the American West. Soon after the United States occupied the Alaska territory, many artists, including Bierstadt, painted in the area. In 1889, Bierstadt traveled to Alaska on the steamer Ancon. The Ancon was wrecked and Bierstadt, along with the other passengers, stayed in Indian huts and salmon canneries for five days until the next steamer brought them back to Vancouver. During that time, Bierstadt created sixty studies and two books of drawings of Alaska.",

    "Micro Summary": "Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902), German-born American landscape painter, created Alaska around 1889 from sketches made during his ill-fated 1889 voyage when the steamer Ancon wrecked, forcing him and fellow passengers to shelter in Indian huts and salmon canneries for five days. Born in Düsseldorf and raised in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Bierstadt studied at the Royal Academy, traveled Europe with fellow Hudson River School painters, and became famous for his monumental landscapes of the American West, particularly the Rocky Mountains. This oil on canvas captures the vast scale of fog-shrouded mountains and wilderness with Indian hunters and dark forest, expressing Bierstadt's sense of wonder before untamed Alaska and suggesting to nineteenth-century viewers a place on the edge of imagination, completed after his return from Vancouver.",

    "Date": "1918",
    "Medium": "oil and tempera on canvas",
    "Artwork Description": "Ritman's interest in decorative patterning is evident in the mixture of floral prints with stripes that contrast with the buzzing confusion of nature seen through the open window. In Sunlit Window, the floral prints of the wallpaper, curtains, and model's blouse co-exist with the potted plant leaves and the emphatic stripes of the venetian blinds and table legs. The orderly patterns contrast abruptly with the buzzing confusion of nature seen through the open window. The striking difference between the style of Early Morning Sunshine (IMA) and Sunlit Window is due to Ritman's contact with the artist Frederick Frieseke, leader of the Giverny Group, who achieved fame with his use of strong, colorful decorative patterns.",
    "Artist Biography": "Louis Ritman enrolled in the École des Beaux Arts in the summer of 1909. Around 1911, he moved to Giverny, where he spent almost two decades. At this time, Ritman came under the influence of the American Impressionists Richard Miller and Frederick Frieseke. He was particularly inspired by their paintings of women in domestic interiors and garden settings. Their approach differed from the previous artists who resided in Giverny because they focused on figure painting over landscapes. A popular subject included women relaxing in their boudoirs or in sunlit gardens. By the summer of 1913, Ritman was producing images of nude and partially draped figures. Ritman, a Chicago artist, settled in Giverny, France near the home of Claude Monet, in 1909.",

    "Micro Summary": "Louis Ritman's \"Sunlit Window\" showcases his fascination with decorative patterning through a complex interplay of floral prints, stripes, and natural elements. The artwork features floral motifs in wallpaper, curtains, and the model's blouse, alongside emphatic stripes from venetian blinds and table legs, all contrasted with potted plant leaves. These orderly interior patterns create a striking juxtaposition against the chaotic natural world visible through the open window. The painting reflects Ritman's artistic evolution influenced by Frederick Frieseke, leader of the Giverny Group, who was renowned for incorporating bold, colorful decorative patterns into his work.",

In this canvas painted about midway through his six-year stay in Europe, Forsyth focuses on the time-worn quality of the woman's hands and facial features.

    "Artist Biography": "William Forsyth was born in California, Ohio, not far from Cincinnati. His early use of the family's walls as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity. When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis. Forsyth started his art studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen. He earned his living painting houses with his brother and used his free time to explore his artistic talents. Forsyth became on of the first student in the newly established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school. His desire for more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these trips home to sell at exhibitions. When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams. After the school closed, Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933. Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the Depression. In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.",

    "Artwork Description": "This work shows an individual with emphasis on his personality. This person's combination of psychological attributes and physical characteristics as his own unique attributes. This concept of capturing the individual's uniqueness is pivotal to understanding Eakins. The pianist's hands aren't visible, neither is there a piano. No symbolism to show he's a pianist. The title identifies his profession. The eyes are arresting. Realism from bags under the eyes to rumpled jacket. These and other examples of his real physicality reveal his personality to the viewers. Forms are built up with a sense of light and shadow. Pigment applied in successive coats, giving depth and transparency. Critics have claimed that he is musing about music. The sitter could be our contemporary today, from haircut to shirt color and style of collar to unconstructed jacket and moustache",
    "Artist Biography": "Thomas Eakins, born 1844, attended Central High in Philadelphia, which stressed skills in drawing as well as a democratic respect for disciplined achievement. In 1862 he studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, then went to Paris to enroll at the École des Beaux-arts. From 1866 to the end of 1869, he worked intensely under Jean-Léon Gérôme. Eakins returned to settle in Philadelphia in July 1870. One of his more famous works, The Gross Clinic, was painted in 1875. The painting's blood-spattered figures show the realism for which Eakins would become well known. He had determined that he would make portrait painting his life's work. Eakins cultivated the broad brushwork and indirect painting techniques of Velasquez, under whom Eakins studied for about six months in Spain on his way home to Philadelphia in 1870. Eakins was also a photographer and an accomplished pianist himself. Although he ultimately painted less than three hundred works, Eakins received commissions for only about twenty-five. He died in 1916.",
    "Tour Guidance": "American Spotlight: Certainly a portraitist of Eakins' stature needs to be emphasized. Learning to Look: Discuss how Eakins is important to the idea of \"looking\" by explaining his own power to observe and record what he observed.",
    "Connections": "Eyes: The eyes of the pianist have an arresting and at the same time almost plaintive quality. They draw the viewer to the painting. In the same way, Mary Shepard Greene Blumenschein's Louisa Fletcher presents a young woman whose expression reveals little. Both figures present a behavior: the pianist seems pensive (perhaps with a tune he's remembering?) while the young woman seems pensive in her own way, unknown to the viewer. Finally, Henry Ossawa Tanner's The Two Disciples at the Tomb, Kneeling Disciple shows us eyes charged with emotion wide open at his vision of the light. The viewer can sense this with or without knowledge of the Bible story. The disciple seems too to have no sense that we are watching him, less even than the musician or the maiden. Realism: In The Pianist (Stanley Addicks), we see a baggy-eyed, multi-hued skin, tousled-haired musician wearing a rumpled jacket. No nips and tucks here, especially since Eakins would have been familiar with Addicks' personality. Eakins is a realist painter. Diagonally across the gallery we see gutted fish, a realistic theme painted in great detail and just as masterfully rendered. Neither work romanticizes the subject. Across from Chase's work, we find Winslow Homer's The Boat Builders. This painting is revealing in at least two ways. First, it is painted in a realistic manner, and second it realistically speaks to us of where the boys are likely to spend their lives, like their dads, on fishing boats which they've replicated. Frames: The frame of The Pianist (Stanley Addicks) contributes to its contemporary appeal. Not only does the subject seem quite contemporary in his looks and dress, with the exception of his tie perhaps, but the frame looks very simple and contemporary. To the right of Eakins' work, Augustus Saint-Gauden's representation of Robert Louis Stevenson also has a \"natural\" frame. It might be interesting to compare the frames of Louisa Fletcher and The Pianist (Stanley Addicks).",

    "Micro Summary": "Thomas Eakins' \"The Pianist (Stanley Addicks)\" exemplifies the artist's commitment to psychological realism through portraiture. The work focuses entirely on capturing the subject's individuality through physical details like bags under his eyes and rumpled clothing, rather than through symbolic elements or professional props. Notably, neither piano nor hands are visible, with only the title indicating Addicks' profession as a pianist. Eakins builds form through careful attention to light, shadow, and layered pigments to create depth and transparency. The timeless quality of the portrait, from the sitter's haircut to his clothing style, demonstrates Eakins' ability to capture universal human character that transcends specific historical periods.",

    "Artist Biography": "African American Artist, Born March 18, 1901 Florence, SC, Died April 13, 1970 Long Island, NY. His early education was intermittent but his drawing skills were developed through cartoon work for local newspapers. At 17 he moved to New York, where he found work as a stevedore, cook and hotel porter. From 1923 to 1926 he attended the National Academy of Design in New York and Hawthorne's Cape Cod School of Art at Provincetown. His graduation funds were raised by supporters to enable him to study in Paris, where he stayed for three years, absorbing the impact of such European Expressionists as Chaim Soutine and simplifying his paintings to bold rhythmic compositions. In Paris he met Holcha Krake, a Danish textile designer, whom he married. The couple traveled through Europe, returning to the USA in 1930. Johnson received an award from the Harmon Foundation for 'Distinguished Achievement among Negroes'. He than developed a broader technique with richness of texture and color. From 1938 in New York, Johnson changed his style to produce flat designs with patterns of brilliant color, emulating stained glass, depicting religious subject and scenes from Black American history. Upon his death, his estate of 1100 works was accommodated by the Harmon Foundation until its closure, when it was dispersed among interested organizations such as the Smithsonian receiving approximately 80%.Among other friends was Eugene O'Neill whose sister-in-law Fisk married in the early 1920's.",
    "Tour Guidance": "Tour Uses: Learning to Look or Highlights: Discuss how flat the figures are and could they be cut-outs? Discuss the simplicity of the painting and how the figures are flat and the buildings have depth. Ask why are there 3 flags? History Tour: Explain the segregated army during WWII, Pres. Truman ended this. Discuss how this painting tells a strong American History Story depicting Average Americans with humor. Explain how the flag is sending the message of freedom (tongue in cheek).",

    "Micro Summary": "\"Training for War\" by William Henry Johnson is a 1941 pochoir (stenciled and hand-painted) work depicting segregated African American soldiers during World War II. Created by the Harlem Renaissance artist, this piece is part of a five-painting series showing various aspects of Black military service, from training to combat to casualties. The series was selected through an open competition by the Office of Emergency Management for a major traveling exhibition supporting the war effort. Johnson painted African Americans with dignity and social realism rather than derogatory stereotypes, making this historically significant artwork both rare to see outside the Smithsonian and important for its authentic portrayal of segregated military service.",

    "Micro Summary": "William Bradford (1823-1892), American marine painter born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, created Whaler and Fishing Vessels near the Coast of Labrador around 1880, following his series of annual trips to Nova Scotia, Labrador, and Greenland from 1861 through 1869. Bradford, son of Quaker parents who worked in his father's dry goods store before launching his professional career painting ship portraits, became famous alongside Frederic Edwin Church for popularizing Arctic subjects in American art, capturing the Romantic era's fascination with exotic places and adventure. This oil on canvas depicts icebergs as symbols of nature's perpetual formation and destruction—viewed as icy equivalents of mountains representing physical and spiritual grandeur—with whaling and fishing vessels adding human presence that tempers the awesome scale of nature, demonstrating the Hudson River School's inclination to interpret nature in spiritual terms and showing humanity existing on equal terms with the natural world.",
